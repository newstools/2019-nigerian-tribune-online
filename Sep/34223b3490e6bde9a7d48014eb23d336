PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has extended warm felicitations to Mr Segun Awolowo, Executive Director of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), on his 56th birthday. He particularly congratulated him for consistently serving the nation for many years, including working with four presidents. Special Adviser to the President on Media & Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina in a statement on Friday in Abuja, said President Buhari joined family members, friends and professional colleagues of the lawyer and scion of Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s family in celebrating another milestone. Buhari noted that the Executive Director of NEPC has demonstrated the same keen interest in humanity, and patriotism in affairs of the nation that separated his grandfather for commendation.
