As schools in Ogun State resume for another academic calendar, the Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has ordered the suspension of the N3,700 education levy inherited from the previous administration. Governor Abiodun, who decried the public outcry generated by the fee, said his administration did not introduce any levy, saying it was a proposal by Parents Teacher Association (PTA) which was accepted and implemented by the previous administration. Abiodun made this known at a day stakeholders’ forum with the theme, “Repositioning Education for Outstanding Performance”, held at the June 12 Cultural Center, Kuto, Abeokuta.

He said: “I have been criticized in the media about the N3,700 PTA fee. I did not introduce the fee. It was proposed by the PTA and accepted by the previous administration. The fee negates the free education policy of this administration. It is like payment through the back door. “I hereby suspend the payment in all our schools. We will also look into the issue of Principal and Headmaster General.” Prince Abiodun who described condition of schools in the State as pathetic, said he has restored running cost to all schools as those who manage the schools have responsibility of keeping them functioning always.
