A Catholic cleric, Reverend Father Augustine Akubue, has enjoined everyone to prepare for eternity by living righteously and shunning sin and evil. Akubue gave the charge in a homily he delivered at St. Joseph’s Catholic Parish, Ukana in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State during the burial mass of Mrs Juliet Ugwu. The cleric said that no great thing or journey could be undertaken without preparation, even “as students prepare for examination; those that want to wed prepare for it.” EFCC arrests two suspected internet fraudsters wanted by FBI “Likewise, for us to meet the demand for eternity, we must prepare very well for it through how we live our lives daily. Everyday should live as if it is our last day on earth.

Third, her death is reminding us that are still living, that every survival is a postponement of death. “Fourth, where she has gone now; by the grace of God Almighty, we will be there at the appointed time,” he said.
