The UN’s refugee agency said the turmoil had created a “new humanitarian emergency” that would require a fresh inter-agency fundraising effort of $35.5 million by the end of the year. UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said Boko Haram, the Islamist group that has waged a decade-long insurgency in the north of the country, was not responsible for the latest attacks.
