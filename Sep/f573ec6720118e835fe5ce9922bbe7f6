As Nigeria celebrates its 59th independence, an Economist, Dr Chijioke Ekechukwu, has advised the Federal Government to give priority to agriculture in budget allocation, policies and decision making. Ekechukwu, a former Director-General, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), gave this advice in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Monday.
