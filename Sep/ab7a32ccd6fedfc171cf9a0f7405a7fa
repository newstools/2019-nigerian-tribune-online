Mr Sunday, a mechanic, said he was bewildered after the result of a scan indicated that his wife was pregnant with triplets but he said that with the support of well-to-do people in the society, he was confident that the children would survive. He thanked the Muslim community in Akoko North-West Local Government for the donation and urged other individuals and organisations to come to the aid of his family. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
