The commander lauded the state government for its support in the area of logistics to the command. He, however, appealed to Gov. Darius Ishaku to provide accommodation for the staff, a rehabilitation centre and a bigger store for the command. He said, “Currently, we take those being rehabilitated to Bauchi State while some of our seized drugs are stored in Yola because our store in Jalingo is too small to accommodate seized drugs.” He also appealed to the residents of the state to provide the command with useful information that would lead to the arrest of illicit drug dealers.
