Mr Adeolu Ogunbanjo, the President of National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS) has urged telecommunications operators to enlighten subscribers on data tariffs to avoid complaints. Ogunbanjo, in an interview in Lagos last week said that with constant enlightenment, consumers would be able to choose the data packages they want. He noted that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had been organising Telecoms Consumer Parliament (TCP) meetings so that network providers interface with consumers. “The TCPs are usually held at urban centres for cities and town halls for those rural communities.

He said that sensitisation workshops would create an understanding between network providers and their subscribers. He noted that once there is an understanding between both parties, there would be less complaint on data tariffs. Ogunbanjo urged telecoms operators to improve on the quality of services they give to subscribers. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
