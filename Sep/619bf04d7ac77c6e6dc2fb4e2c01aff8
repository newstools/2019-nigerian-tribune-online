Barely three days after they closed down their outlets in Warri and Asaba for fear of reprisals over the killings of Nigerians in South Africa last Sunday, South Africa-linked business concerns, Shoprite and MTN have commenced skeletal services amid water-tight security in the twin cities of Delta State. Checks by Tribune Online Saturday morning revealed that Shoprite, strategically located inside the Delta Mall near Effurun Roundabout, commenced sales at their usual 9:00 a.m. A potpourri of well-armed security agents were, however, sighted manning the two gates and some pacing around the mall and keeping eagle-eye surveillance on the property.

However, a customer, who declined to identify herself, expressed excitement at the reopening of Shoprite on Saturday morning. The elated lady, who was carting away her purchases, simply smiled and retorted when asked about the reopening thus: “I’m happy ooo my brother. I had wanted to come and shop for my birthday but this xenophobic wahala made them closed shop. So I raced down here when I heard they’ve reopened. I’m really excited.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
