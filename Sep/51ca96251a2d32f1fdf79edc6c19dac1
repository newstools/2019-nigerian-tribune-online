A 32-year old up-and-coming gospel artiste, Omobowale Opeyemi Bright, who has been diagnosed with kidney failure, requires N8 million for a kidney transplant. Bright, a graduate of Business Administration and former Student Union Government (SUG) Social Director at the Polytechnic Ibadan is at present living in pain and discomfort as he is unable to raise the money for his treatment and is calling on well-meaning Nigerians to come to his rescue. According to him, the health challenge started last year but his family  had been managing it privately but he now has to appeal for public support because that was the last option as the family cannot afford to raise N8 million for the treatment. Bright is presently at home as he can’t afford the daily payment for a bed space but goes for dialysis at Clinix Health Care Ilupeju, every four days.
