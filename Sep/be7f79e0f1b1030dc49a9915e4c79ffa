The co-founder of BudgIT, Seun Onigbinde, has been trending on Twitter, over his appointment as a Technical Adviser in the Ministry of Budget and National Planning. Onigbinde, a known staunch critic of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has been a subject of discussion on the micro-blogging site, Twitter, with a faction of discussants condemning him for accepting to serve in his new role. It was said that for his past unfriendly stance against the government, with a series of past “offensive” statements made against Buhari, he should have reconsidered taking up a job with his administration. Onigbinde, had, via his Medium account announced his new role, and while he said he had accepted to take up the new appointment, he said he would be stepping aside from direct involvement in BudgIT duties. For this decision, he had been criticised over his decision to work with the current national leadership. Onighinde’s adversaries on Twitter, earlier before now had also condemned him for deleting his Twitter account probably to cover up his past statements against Buhari administration and escape reactions that have trailed the news of his new appointment. But as the argument turned red with rage, and the discussion on Twitter became hotter, the supposedly deleted Twitter account of Onigbinde @seunonigbinde resurfaced. However, contrary to the belief that he had been appointed directly by President Buhari, Onigbinde, on his Medium page, last Saturday, clarified the mode of his appointment. According to him, he said he would be taking up an advisory role which was underwritten by an international development agency for an initial period of six months in the Ministry of Budget and National Planning. In his new role, he said he would be working with the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.
