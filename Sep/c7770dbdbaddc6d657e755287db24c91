Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has been asked to stop debasing the legacies of Chief Obafemi Awolowo by linking the sage to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, gave the charge on Friday in its reaction to claims made earlier that day in Ekiti State by Professor Osinbajo that the APC was Chief Awolowo’s party. Afenifere, in a statement sent to Saturday Tribune by its spokesman, Yinka Odumakin, urged young Nigerians who did not know Chief Awolowo not to “accept the untruth that what we have on ground today was what Awo represented.” “The Vice President was being apostate when he claimed APC belongs to Awo. Our leader must have turned in his grave to hear such debasement of what he stood for – his legacies.
