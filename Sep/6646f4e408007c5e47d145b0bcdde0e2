The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) says the appeal filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, rejecting the election of President Muhammadu Buhari at the Supreme Court will fail. BMO in a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju in Abuja on Thursday described PDP’s appeal as an exercise in futility. Akinsiju added that the appeal would only re-emphasise the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) which ruled that the petition was futile and had no substance.

He said that if they had thoroughly digested the judgement they would not have wasted their resources on filing an appeal. “It was one of the very few times that five justices would sit to deliver judgment and be unanimous in their decision.

Any reasonable person would know that. “The petition was bound to fail – in whatever direction it took. And it will fail again,” he said. Akinsiju said that Atiku’s appeal was to satisfy the pressure of marabouts who had deceived him into believing that he stood a chance at the poll and in the courts. “What the Supreme Court will do is put a final nail in the coffin where PDP and Atiku’s petition lies. We strongly believe the Supreme Court would do nothing less than striking out the appeal of the PDP,” he said.
