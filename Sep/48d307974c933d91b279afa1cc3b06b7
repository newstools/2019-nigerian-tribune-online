Housemate Chimeke Okoye aka Frodd has won the ultimate veto power in the ongoing BBNaija season four. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the excited housemate, who could not contain his joy, won the coveted chance card on Sunday night. Following a normal live show without eviction, Biggie called the housemates into the arena to perform the veto task. Prior to the task, housemates had kept a red box for one week from which they drew out random picture cards. Suspense was created around the box as housemates did not know the power the veto holder would have. To heat things up, negligence with the box caused Elozonam, Cindy and Diane to be issued a strike each.
