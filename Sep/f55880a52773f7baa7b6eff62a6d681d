The governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, yesterday claimed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) does not have a validly nominated candidate for the forthcoming November 16 governorship election, saying the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would win fairly. Speaking during a media chat in the Government House, Yenagoa, Dickson said the candidate of the APC, Chief David Lyon, emerged through a direct primary where votes were allocated to candidates in a hotel in Yenagoa. He said such a candidate does not have the moral justification to stand for an election, adding that in days to come, the news that APC has no validly nominated governorship candidate would be exposed. He expressed confidence that Bayelsans are enlightened enough not to fall for the antics of the APC, urging them to vote for the PDP that is a party of stability.

I am not a member of their party but I am an interested party. “A party must be responsible to protect the democratic ideals of our people. I am a bystander but I am watching their activities for the interest of our people. “However, I look forward to a very peaceful campaign. I also look forward to issue-based campaign where candidates would go to our communities to convince them for their votes.” Here is how i overcome QUICK RELEASE and make it BIGGER, STRONGER And LONGER with this NAFDAC APPROVED NATURAL REMEDY.
