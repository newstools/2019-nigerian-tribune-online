The Imo State Election Tribunal has dismissed three petitions seeking to upturn the election of Emeka Ihedioha as governor of the state. The chairman of the tribunal, Justice Umar Dogondaji, in its ruling on Saturday, thereafter affirmed the election of Ihedioha as the lawfully elected governor of the state. Three petitions were filed by the governorship candidates of the Action Alliance (AA), All Progressives Congress, (APC) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), asking the tribunal to nullify the election of Mr Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on the ground that he was unlawfully declared as the governor of the state by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
