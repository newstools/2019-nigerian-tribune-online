The national president of the Judiciary Staff Union Of Nigeria (JUSUN), Comrade Marwan Mustapha Adamu, has returned over N13 million overpaid members checkoff to the Delta State government. Comrade Adamu returned the sum recently when he personally presented the cheque to the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) in his (SSG) office While presenting the cheque, he informed the SSG that the JUSUN national headquarters received dues centrally from all the states of the federation. But he stated that the union noticed that the amount released by the Delta State government for the July 2019 checkoff was far above the usual, which prompted the national headquarters to direct its state branch chairman, Comrade Austin Chiejina to confirm the payment.

He noted that the union has again proved that the judiciary is a place of noble act. He congratulated the union for having Noble personality at the helm of its affairs both at the National and State level. The SSG promised to inform the State Governor of the development.
