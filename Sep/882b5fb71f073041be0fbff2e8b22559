 The anti-graft agency in an affidavit insisted that the items were beyond Diezani’s “known and provable lawful income.” According to an EFCC investigator, Rufai Zaki, Diezani was appointed the Minister of Petroleum Resources on April 12, 2010. Zaki, however, alleged that findings by the EFCC showed that she started acquiring the jewellery in 2012 from one Bukola Oyewumi of Trinket Box Bespoke Jewellery at Ikeja City Mall, Alausa. The investigator said the EFCC was in possession of the details of the UBA account through which Diezani received her salary as a minister. “The respondent did not utilise her salary or any part of her legitimate income to acquire the assets sought to be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria,” Zaki said. Zaki’s said the EFCC invited Oyewumi and she made a statement, saying she started selling jewellery to Diezani in 2012.  He said the EFCC also discovered that apart from Oyewumi, Diezani also bought jewellery from one Minal Ratanani of Bella Vista Apartment, Banana Island, Ikoyi, According to him, she admitted during questioning by the EFCC that Diezani bought jewellery worth $865,300.00 from her over a period and she paid cash. Counsel for the EFCC, Rotimi Oyedepo, said it was in the best interest of justice for the court to order the permanent forfeiture of the jewellery and the gold iPhone to the Federal Government.  But Diezani, through her counsel, Nnamdi Awa-Kalu, insisted that the seizure of the items amounted to a violation of Diezani’s constitutional right to own properties. Justice Nicholas Oweibo adjourned till September 11, 2019, for the ruling. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
