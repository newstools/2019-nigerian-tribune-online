The threat by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) that it will disrupt academic activities in the institution if the Osun State Government ‘refuses to pay their outstanding two months’ salaries,’ is not only misguided but presumptuous,  the Osun government has said. In a statement titled: “ASUU’s position on LAUTECH: Setting the record straight,” signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prince Wole Oyebamiji, the government noted that ASUU’s position on the salary arrears does not truly reflect the position of things, especially with regard to Osun which appears to have been singled out for vilification by the union.

This explains why from 2013 till date, only Osun has been shouldering the payment of salaries of workers at the LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Osogbo,  amounting to N16, 604, 510, 806.12. “It is also important to note here that, long before the current back and forth overpayment of salaries, the rotational payment between the two states had collapsed. Therefore, the claim by ASUU that Oyo had paid from January to June 2019, and as such, Osun should pay from July to December this year, does not hold water. The argument will only make meaning if Oyo had been paying salaries of workers at the LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Osogbo,” Prince Oyebamiji added.

He further said: “For emphasis, below is the analysis of what Oyo contributed: January- N73, 977, 759. 10, February- N73, 977, 759.10, March – N73, 977, 759.10,  April – N295, 969, 650.11,  May – N295, 969, 650.11 and June – N295, 969, 560.11, whereas Osun, within the same period, had contributed : January -N235, 967, 856.98, February – N239,783,757.04, March -N239, 642, 219.14, April- N239, 007,500.28, May- N235,382,043.73 and June – N235, 251,415.70, to LAUTECH  Teaching Hospital, Osogbo. The state, as earlier stated had gone ahead to contribute another N230, 923,499.67 and N234, 556, 975.64 as of July and August salaries respectively, for LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Osogbo. “    Here is how i overcome QUICK RELEASE and make it BIGGER, STRONGER And LONGER with this NAFDAC APPROVED NATURAL REMEDY.
