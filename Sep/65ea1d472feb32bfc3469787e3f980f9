MONEY MARKET IN the just concluded week, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sold treasury bills worth N302.42 billion through Open Market Operation (OMO) which partly offset the matured T-bills worth N422.05 billion. Hence, the liquidity impact of net inflows worth N119.63 billion as well as the recently distributed N720.88 billion by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FACC) accounted for the ease in the financial system liquidity. Consequently, the Nigeria Interbank Offered Rate (NIBOR) for overnight funds, one month and six months tenure buckets moderated to 9.19 per cent (from 14.20 per cent), 13.16 per cent (from 13.29 per cent) and 13.95 per cent (from 14.31 per cent) respectively. However, analysts from Cowry Assets Management said NIBOR for three months tenure bucket increased to 13.69 per cent (from 13.44 per cent). Meanwhile, Nigeria Interbank Treasury True Yields (NITTY) dipped for most maturities tracked as investors’ demand for treasury bills in the secondary market increased, yields on one month, six months and 12 months dwindled to 12.33 per cent (from 12.49 per cent), 12.88 per cent (from 13.29 per cent) and 15.10 per cent (from 15.21 per cent) respectively, However, yield on three months maturity increased to 12.61 per cent (from 12.03 per cent). 2019 UTME: Over 100,000 candidates now in universities ― JAMB NeFF welcomes re-introduction  of cashless policy GTBank informs NSE scheduled of closed trading period CIR: How costs ate into  some banks’ profits Some banks cross hurdle as CBN’s 60% LDR mandate expires… FOREX MARKET IN the just concluded week, Naira/Dollar (NGN/USD) rate fell (i.e. Naira appreciated) at the Investors and Exporters foreign exchange (FX) Window (I&E FXW) by 0.10 per cent to close at N362.02/USD, in line with our expectation.
