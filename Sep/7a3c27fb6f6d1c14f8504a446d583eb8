The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) says it has issued 36.6 million National Identity Numbers – NIN to Nigerians as at Sept. 11. Mr Aliyu Aziz, the Director-General of the commission, disclosed this at an interactive session with newsmen on Thursday, ahead of National Identity Day celebration in the country, slated for Sept. 16. Aziz said the ongoing enrolment of citizens for the NIN would help to address security challenges confronting the country as it would enable security agencies to identify the culprits via their national identity database. “Security challenge is a known problem, so if everyone is identified in Nigeria via national identity number, anytime somebody commits crime, he or she can be easily identified.
