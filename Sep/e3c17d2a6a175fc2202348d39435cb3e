Wada’s winning votes. In the case of Abubakar Ibrahim Idris, the Committee noted that contrary to the aspirant’s claims that extraneous ballot papers were used at the primary, the panel confirmed that all the ballot papers used were serially numbered and the declaration made by the electoral committee was in accordance with the serial numbers contained on the ballot papers. No petition was received from any of the aspirants that contested in the Bayelsa state primary where Senator Douye Diri emerged as the party’s governorship candidate. Consequently, the PDP has submitted the name of Engr. Musa Wada as its candidate for the November 16 governorship election in Kogi state to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The party has also submitted the name of Hon. Samuel Bamidele Aro, a former member of the House of Representatives as running mate to Engr. Wada. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
