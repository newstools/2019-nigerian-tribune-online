According to a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, Daura community will receive additional assistance from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). It said: “Contrary to the allegations that President Muhammadu Buhari has turned his back on the people of Daura, we can confirm that pre-assessment relief materials were dispatched to the victims within 48 hours of the floods.
