Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has recovered N97.7bn from tax defaulters through the lien it ordered on tax defaulters bank accounts. Executive Chairman of FIRS, Mr Babatunde Fowler disclosed this in Abuja on Wednesday at the 49th Annual Accountant Conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) in Abuja. In a presentation titled “FIRS power of substitution: Critical review and matters arising” he insisted that despite criticisms of the practice, he will do whatever he could to boost tax collections. He explained that FIRS took such a harsh stance only after the failure of the tax amnesty programme called Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS).

He said, “As at today there are a total of 23,141 tax defaulters who are yet to come forward to clear their outstanding liabilities of about N254bn. “FIRS in collaboration with the banks have started engaging in compliance measures with regards to the tax defaulters and their accounts. “Failure to carry out this directive will result in the banks being sanctioned according to Section 31 subsection 1-3 and 32 respectively of FIRS Act 2007″ adding that sanctions involve immediate delisting of such banks from FIRS collection list.
