The primary role of the traffic wardens on Nigerian roads is to control the movement of vehicles plying the roads and to educate road users to obey traffic laws as well as warn them not to park their cars at wrong locations in order to avoid unnecessary traffic holdups or avoidable accidents. It is on this premise that the Inspector General of police, Adamu Muhammed, should ensure the promotion of deserving traffic wardens serving in all the 36 states of the federation, including Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory as the onerous task he should carry out as the police boss without any further delay. For the IGP to complement the efforts of his traffic warden in Nigeria, it is also necessary that he forwards the names of the deserving officers to the appropriate authority for consideration. There is the need to make them happy. Any officer who deserves promotion should not be deprived of his right of moving from one rank to another.
