These kinds of stretch marks aren’t dangerous, and they often disappear over time. However, steroid creams, lotions, and pills can also cause stretch marks by decreasing the skin’s ability to stretch. Therefore, if you are using such creams and lotions (Toning and Skin Lightening Creams) you will need to avoid them. In addition, some ailments can cause stretch marks by increasing the amount of cortisone in your body. My advice will be for you to wait for a while to see if the stretch marks will disappear. If not, a comprehensive medical check up with a doctor will be advisable. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
