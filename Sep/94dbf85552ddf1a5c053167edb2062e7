JUSTICE Mojisola Dada of the Lagos State High Court sitting in Ikeja has convicted one Lawrence Maduagwu to 10 years imprisonment for $179,000 fraud. A statement obtained from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) website said that the convict was arraigned by the EFCC, Lagos Zonal office on Feb. 28, 2018, on a two-count charge. The two-count charge bordered on stealing and obtaining $179,000 by false pretence. It said that Maduagwu was introduced to the complainant, PMC Industry Limited, a Chinese company, through its Nigerian representative, Ohio Ileogben, as a businessman who deals in calcium chloride chemicals. It stated that the convict, however, failed to pay for the 500 metric tonnes of calcium powder valued at the sum of $179,000, after taking delivery of the items and efforts to get him to pay for the goods were unsuccessful.
