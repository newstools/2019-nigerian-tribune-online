UNITED Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has raised concerns over severe acute malnutrition threat in some northern states, especially Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The Fund said urgent attention is required to contain the situation, as over 440,000 children in the three states are likely to face severe acute malnutrition by the end of 2019. This was contained in a presentation made by UNICEF nutrition specialist, Abigail Nyukuri, at United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) sponsored media dialogue in Maiduguri, on Thursday.

She said the problem of malnutrition was worsened by inability of local and international health and rescue workers to access some communities in Rann, Magumeri, Jere and Konduga LGAs in Borno due to recent increase in activities of insurgents. Nyukuri added that N4.4 billion was required to close the gap for the procurement of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) for malnourished children. She also said that the RUTF was needed to be distributed to malnourished children in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps.
