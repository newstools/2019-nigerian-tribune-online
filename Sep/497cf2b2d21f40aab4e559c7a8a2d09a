President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed shock and grief over the death of a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation,  Chief Ufot Ekaette, describing him as “a consummate administrator and bridge-builder”. Buhari in a condolence message issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Thursday, noted that the deceased ”dedicated himself to duty in the course of his distinguished public service.” Buhari said Ekaette was ”a gentleman” who gave “his best in the service of his country”.
