The General  Overseer of the Word Bible Church, Prophet Julius Babatunde Kumoluyi, has advised the Federal Government to place priority on the education sector to end the current insecurity challenges in the country. He said the amount of money currently being expended on the school feeding programme by the Federal Government should have been used to provide free education across the country. The cleric stated this while speaking with newsmen in his Igbara-Odo home, Ekiti South West Local Government Area of Ekiti State, ahead of the 30th anniversary of the ministry. ‘Government officials must always have time for God’ Don’t run after the world, Fape charges clerics Cleric urges prayers for Nigerians facing xenophobic attacks OAIC wants S/West governors to draw master plan for region No bomb explosion at South African High Commission ― FG Kumoluyi, who maintained that the billions of naira on the programme was enough to give quality education to the  children across Nigeria,  added that parents would provide feeding for their  children if education was made free. “I think the insecurity we have in our country today shows the government has to be alive to its responsibilities. Government responsibility has been neglected in the area of  availability of employment opportunities. The jobs are not available. “What do you want someone who passed out from the university after 10 years and no job to do? It is a very sad situation and that is why they are looking for ways to survive. The way things are going, it might get worse until government performs its responsibility,” he said.
