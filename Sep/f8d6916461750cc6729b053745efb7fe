The emir, ‎who described the new council as “first-class”, said the move was “timely and reflective of  Buhari’s determination to re-energise the management of the economy”. He said Nigerians were highly desirous of such an effective and knowledge-driven team to provide the lead on the economic front.‎ According to him,  the beauty of the team, apart from the pedigree of its members, is their private sector experience and their independence.‎ “If you look at the system we operate, if you also look at the United States, every US president always has a council of economic advisers. “One of the reasons you have this council is you want independent academics who are able to give you frank and honest ‎advice on how to run the economy and address its problems. ‎ALSO READ: FG tasks state governors on internal security “What the president has done is to follow that pattern to appoint a team of highly respected professionals to advise him, ‎especially‎ this time when we have economic problems, fiscal issues.
