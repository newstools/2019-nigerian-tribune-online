As Nigeria marks the 2019 National Symbols Day, the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Gombe State has called on Nigerians to imbibe the right attitude of respect for Nigeria’s national symbols as a way of entrenching the spirit of our collective nationality. These national symbols include the Coat of Arms, Nigerian Flag, National Anthem, National Pledge, the Naira, Nigerian Passport, and National Identity Card, all of which must be treated with care to avoid mutilation, stains, improper rendition or display as the case may be.
