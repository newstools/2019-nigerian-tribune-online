An upcoming Nigerian Singer Raji Mutiu said he used proceeds from his conductor job to produce his first album. The hip hop singer, popularly known as Bright Okiki said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Friday. He said that getting support as an upcoming artist was very challenging. He added that no matter the depth of his talent if he had no support success would be a long walk in the park. “Big shots in the music industry believe that supporting an upcoming artist is a waste of money; they even ask for money from such upcoming artists if they wanted the singers to feature in their videos. “They look down on you regardless of your good skills in singing or your ambitions to succeed in the business. “I started singing at age 14 and as an orphan, I had no one to support me, I did a lot of odd jobs to push my career myself without any money at all,” he said.
