Authorities of the Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE), Ekiti State, have announced the indefinite closure of the institution and the proscription of its students’ union. In a statement made available toTribuneOnline, the management of the university said it took the decision following the unruly behaviour of students who on Tuesday, September 10 staged a violent protest against epileptic power supply from the electricity company, IBEDC, to the communities of Oye and Ikole. During Tuesday’s protest, students were said to have blocked the Abuja-Ado, and Ijan-Ikole highways from the early hours of the day till about 2 pm when they temporarily dispersed after much persuasion by FUOYE’s internal security and federal security agents.
