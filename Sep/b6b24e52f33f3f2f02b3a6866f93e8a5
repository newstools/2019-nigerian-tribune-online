The UK Home Office  are introducing a Tier 1 Exceptional Talent Route; The Point Based System for  individuals with skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics  This initiative will ensure that those with these skills can come to the UK. Unlike other current UK immigration categories, this new scheme will provide eligible individuals with a three-year visa.  It is worth noting that most UK immigration categories have a 5-year residency requirement to live in the UK legally before migrants can obtain Indefinite Leave to Remain How to prepare for job interview At the end of three years, those on the scheme would be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain; giving them a permanent right to reside in the UK and access to the same benefits and healthcare as British citizens.  There will be no minimum salary requirement, and individuals do not need to secure a job before arriving in the UK.  Another exciting fact is that unlike other immigration categories, individuals who successfully migrate to the UK on this scheme will be able to include and bring their adult dependants including other dependants (spouse and CV children) and they will have full access to the labour market. The above information is those who are exceptionally brilliant in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
