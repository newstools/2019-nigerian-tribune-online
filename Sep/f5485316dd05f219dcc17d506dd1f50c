Operatives of Lagos State Taskforce have, in the early hours of Friday, raided an illegal brothel around Mile 2 area of the state and arrested five notorious miscreants and nine prostitutes found with illegal drugs. Chairman of the agency, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, disclosed this in a release issued by his office, saying the raid was occasioned by complaints by members of the public that criminal activities around Mile 2 towards Festac were perpetrated by miscreants who resided in the illegal brothel. The Task Force boss further disclosed that the brothel had previously been demolished by the agency during the clearing of illegal structures, shanties and containerised shops from Eric Moore Road down to Trade Fair axis. This was just as he confirmed that the said brothel had again been demolished by the agency as it happened in the past.
