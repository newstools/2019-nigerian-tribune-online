Governor Seyi Makinde has been described as a rare politician who demonstrated a strong commitment to the welfare of the people of the state within his first 100 days in office. Factional chairman of the proscribed state chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Alhaji Abideen Ejiogbe, made the commendation in a statement made available on Sunday. He said the governor had used the first 100 days to a solid foundation for the promotion of people’s welfare through prompt payment of workers’ salary and gratuity of pensioners. The NURTW leader also lauded the governor for the provision of free a and qualitative education, healthcare delivery, the security of lives and property and infrastructural development.

He, however, called on the governor to lift the ban on Oyo NURTW, assuring that he and his members would continue to embrace and ensure peace in all parts of the state. He also charged the people to pray for the Makinde administration in order to ensure that the dividends of democracy could reach all the nooks and crannies of the state. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
