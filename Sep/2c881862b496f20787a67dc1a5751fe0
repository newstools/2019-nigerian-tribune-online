Agege Area Superintendent, The Apostolic Church Nigeria, Pastor Felix Olotu, has said that meaningful engagement of youths will solve the problem of insecurity in the country. Olotu noted that any society without developing the youths would go into extinction. He made this known at a briefing announcing the commemoration of the silver jubilee convention of the church in Lagos State. “Criminalities in our country would have been addressed if the youths have been meaningfully engaged. “We are aware that any society without developing the youths will go into extinction. Efforts should be made at making sure that they are useful to the society,” Olotu said.
