The Minister of interior, Mr  Rauf Aregbesola has been urged to compel authorities of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to look holistically into the plights of the old volunteers of corps with a view to enlist some of them who are still able to serve in the security agency. Coordinator of the old volunteers in Osun State, Comrade Sunday Oyedokun made the appeal in a meeting in Osogbo with the executives’ member of the old volunteers. He stressed that Aregbesola should not hesitate to look into the plights of the old volunteers of NSCDC who are yet to be absorbed since the inception of the NSCDC about 31 years ago.

He contended that before the authorities of NSCDC must invite state coordinators of old volunteers and brief them on how their plight would be looked into, top brass of the agency should not welcome and entertain fake coordinators of old volunteers of the NSCDC, rather they should ask them to come forward and identify their men or rather bring the list of their men who have served the NSCDC meritoriously over the years as volunteers then. Oyedokun added that in order to give the old volunteers a sense of belongings, the only thing the authorities of the NSCDC should do is to enlist the offsprings of the old volunteers in the ongoing recruitment exercise of the corps without further delay. He explained that a lot of the very old volunteers have died and the only thing the government can do to compensate their families is to employ their dependants who are able and willing to serve their fatherland through the NSCDC.
