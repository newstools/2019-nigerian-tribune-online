PROJECT Pink Blue, a non-profit organisation, says that prostate cancer treatment remains a huge burden to Nigerian men who were diagnosed with the ailment. Mr Runcie Chidebe, Executive Director of the organisation, said this in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja. He noted that it was important for cancer patients to be given adequate support as it was not easy for them to pay out of pocket to get quality treatment.

Many of these men would just decide to stay back at home and die. “With poor national health insurance, it has become more financially stressful to cope with the financial burden of cancer in Nigeria. “Very few families can afford to foot the bills of diagnosis, surgery and treatment. “If the issue of cancer is not immediately placed in the front burner of our national, regional and state health plan, we will continue to lose our human resources, that is, our fathers, mentors, brothers, and friends at such time when they are most needed,’’ Chidebe said. He said that as September is marked as the prostate cancer awareness month and that the Federal Government should consider the inclusion of cancer treatment in the health insurance coverage for all Nigerians.
