Senator Kolawole Balogun (PDP-Oyo South) has described his victory at the Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Ibadan as a renewed hope for the common man. Balogun said this on Tuesday while addressing newsmen at his campaign office in Ibadan shortly after the tribunal had upheld his election. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Balogun had defeated former Gov. Abiola Ajimobi of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Oyo South Senatorial District election held on February 23. NAN reports that Ajimobi had dragged Balogun to the election petitions tribunal to challenge his victory at the poll.
