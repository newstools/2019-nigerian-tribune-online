It is unlawful for anyone to kill another human being. In shocking circumstances, some yet-to-be identified serial killers stormed Ibadan and murdered six innocent citizens of Oyo State with grinding stone at Abatakan Ojoo,  Fatokun Olomowewe in Akinyele Local government and used handkerchief to clean their blood for rituals. It is inhuman and barbaric to see some heartless people snuff lives out of Oyo indigenes like chickens. However, I want to urge the Oyo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Shina Olukolu, not to sleep on the matter until he fishes out the killers of the said six people before they go round to kill others. Bayelsa poll: Tension mounts as aspirants step down for Dickson’s anointed candidate Boosting education through SBMC synergy Social media and rumours Nigeria needs a rebirth What would we do without teachers? Police must do everything within its power to expose them. I also want to urge Mr.Olukolu to use his good offices to constitute a special intelligence detective team to begin investigation into these killings so as to get to the root of the matter expeditiously. This will not only add to the achievement of Mr.Shina Olukolu if he can expose them; it will also make the state safer. I am saying this because nobody knows the next victim. This is also to appeal to the police boss to beef up security around the people of Ibadan, particularly those living at Abatakan Ojoo area in Akinyele Local Government Area. It is true that he is doing his best to combat crime in Oyo State considering the number of armed robbery suspects and ritual killers that have been paraded. There is an urgent need for the police commissioner to increase the number of patrol vans. Jimoh Mumin Esq. Ibadan. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
