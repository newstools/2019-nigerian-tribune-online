The National Association of Nigerian Travel Agency (NANTA) has announced plans to host nationwide training for International Airline Transport Association (IATA) and Non-IATA registered travel agencies in Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Abuja at no cost. Tagged ‘IATA EasyPay Workshop for IATA and Non-IATA Agents’, the president of the association, Mr. Bankole Bernard said the purpose of the workshop was to enlighten Travel Agents on the IATA EasyPay (IEP) plan. “IATA EasyPay (IEP) is a new payment method that is globally available to all IATA accredited travel agents for the issuance of tickets through IATA’s Billing Settlement Plan (BSP). IATA EasyPay is a secure, pay-as-you-go solution. It is an electronic wallet and is available to agents to use alongside the other payment methods in the BSP,” Bankole stated.

Speaking on the benefits of the workshop for the travel agencies, Bankole declared: “The IEP will provide travel agents with more flexibility, it will also provide a failsafe, allowing travel agents to continue transacting in the Billing Settlement Plan (BSP) if they ever reach their Remittance Holding Capacity (RHC).” Speaking in the same vein, the National Publicity Secretary for the Association, Mr. Yinka Ladipo added that the workshop which was kickstarted from the Port Harcourt Zone on September 10, 2019 will be followed by the Abuja Zone today, September 12, 2019 while the Lagos Zone will hold on October 3, 2019, at Lagos Continental Hotel.
