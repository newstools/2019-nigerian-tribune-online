Dr Afunanya declared that the sole aim of the perpetrators “is to set the country on fire as well as inflame passions across ethnic and religious divides with expected violent consequences”. The Service also expressed dismay over the increasing use of fake news and unsubstantiated information spread across social media platforms to deceive and incite sections of the populace to civil unrest. While condemning the unpatriotic and misguided activities of these anti-social elements, the Service advised citizens to remain law-abiding, peaceful and report any suspicions likely to inhibit public safety to appropriate authorities in the country. On its part, the Service promised that it would remain committed in its pursuit of national stability in line with its statutory mandate of protecting the country against crimes and threats to its internal security.
