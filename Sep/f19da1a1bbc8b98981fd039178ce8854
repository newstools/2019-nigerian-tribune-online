Six years after the demise of late Juju veteran, Fatai Rolling Dollar, widow of the deceased, Zainab, has lamented her poor living condition, saying she now lives in penury. Zainab disclosed that six years without her husband had been difficult, adding that she needed a good job that could help her take care of her of two sons. Zainab, who is currently a street sweeper appealed to well-meaning Nigerians to come to her aid . “The suffering is much. I don’t want my children to steal. I was a dealer in soft drinks and beer before, but after the death of my husband, I couldn’t make ends meet again and could not raise money for the business. I tried to go into other businesses, but they failed. I was a supervisor with the Lagos Waste Management Authority LAWMA, but then Visionscape took over, they said I could only be a road or street sweeper or nothing. I have been doing that ever since and the N18, 500 salary is not enough to take care of my two children and myself.

I am just managing. I appeal to good-hearted people, such as the All Progressive Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu to come to my aid. I have not been able to have access to my husband’s royalties either,” she lamented. She revealed that her first child, Jamiu has taken after his father as he is currently in music. She noted that he had recorded a re-mix if his father’s music.
