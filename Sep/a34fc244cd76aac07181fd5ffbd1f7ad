As part of concerted efforts to guarantee energy security in the country, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) have resolved to continue to work hand-in-hand to grow the Petroleum Industry. Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, in conjunction with MOMAN chairman, Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, made the declaration during a visit by the Association’s executive Wednesday in Abuja to the corporation’s helmsman. Speaking during the visit of the Downstream Association, Mallam Kyari stated that statutorily, the corporation was mandated to work with all relevant Industry stakeholders to sustain the growth trajectory of the Petroleum Industry as well as ensure energy security of the nation. He affirmed that effective fuel supply and distribution were critical to national growth and energy security, as NNPC, being a National Oil Company, has an obligation to ensure that petroleum products supply and distribution are carried out unimpeded across the country. He said: “NNPC must work with MOMAN, security agencies and all other relevant stakeholders for the Petroleum Sector to thrive.  We will work with MOMAN as a partner of choice and we are ready to intervene in issues that will promote the growth of the Industry. By so doing, we will encourage you to continue to grow your investment in the country for the economy to prosper.” Man hacked to death over alleged eyeing of married woman in… UNGA video: Buhari’s remark was within context ― Presidency More than 1,100 protesters arrested after demonstration in… Bouteflika’s brother sentenced to 15 years in prison The GMD said the Federal Government was determined to ensure that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) pass legislative hurdles within the shortest possible framework of time to, among others, reduce the incidences of overlapping roles among agencies of government.
