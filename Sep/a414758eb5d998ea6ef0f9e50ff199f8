AFTER a long wait, relief seems to be finally coming the way of electricity consumers in the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) as the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme is set to roll out meters in Edo State. Though the zone is made up of Edo, Delta, Ondo and Ekiti States, only two locations, the Government Reserved Area (GRA) neighbourhood of the Edo State capital and Okpella, Etsako East local government area of Edo State, the site of the multi-million dollars BUA Cement, will however be the only beneficiaries of the scheme. The executive director commercial of BEDC, Mr Abu Ejoor who disclosed this yesterday said that 190,000 metres are scheduled to be rolled out in the next two years with a monthly cumulative average at around 10,000 units. Ejoor explained that in taking off, MAP in BEDC will initially have up to three months of build-up roll out, which will eventually pick up with the expected monthly run rate of 20,000 with a total of 500,000 roll out within the period.

MAP will carry out metre roll-out location by location, route by route, street by street, while the enumeration is a prerequisite for meters which will be handled by three of our MAP parties.” Ejoor lamented that about 30% of power supplied to households are wasted due to inefficient management of use. Also, he said that about 36% of the power generated is lost through commercial theft or illegal consumption and non-payment of bills.
