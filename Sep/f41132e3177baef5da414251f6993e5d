JOINT United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), on Monday, rated Nigeria 62:88:62 in the achievement of Vision 90:90:90 for the year 2020. Vision 2020 is the projection of UNAIDS which stipulates that by the year 2020, about 90 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS should be able to know their status. While 90 per cent of them would be availed with anti-retroviral drugs for treatment, 90 per cent should receive viral suppression.

According to UNAIDS, these are the results of the global rating as of December 2018, for Nigeria as a whole. UNAIDS said that from their survey, “subnational areas such as states or LGAs, the results vary greatly.” UNAIDS, however, said that if the target was not successfully achieved for 2020, the vision was further extended to 95:95:95 by 2030. Mr Batholomew Ochonye, Country Director of Heartland Alliance International (HAI), however, expressed optimism for an HIV free Nigeria. Ochonye, therefore, called on Nigerians to join the global efforts of UNAIDS in achieving viral suppression by 2020. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
