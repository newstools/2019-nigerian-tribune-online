Former Imo state governor and senator representing Imo West,  Rochas Okorocha has said his support for Presidential Muhammadu Buhari ambition in 2015 and membership of the  All Progressives Congress earned him the scorn of people of the South-East geopolitical zone. He made the disclosure on Tuesday in Abuja while speaking with newsmen. Findings revealed that he was a member of the splinter group of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA that teamed up with the defunct Congress for Progressive Change,  the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria and the All Nigerian Peoples Party to form the APC. Also in the alliance was the defunct New People’s Democratic Party, nPDP. Responding to question on his suspension from the party by the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole led national working committee, the former Imo state governor claimed he was a victim of a witch-hunt. He declared that the APC could lose its grip on the electorate by the time President Buhari exhaust his tenure in 2023. He said: “If anything, the party repaid me evil for good. There was no challenge I did not face or bad name I was not called in my state.

I don’t want to talk about it but my party did not treat me well. “I have never thought of leaving the party but what happens next will be determined by time. My only worry is that the party may disappear with the exit of President Buhari if the ongoing injustices are not addressed”. Speaking on the ongoing investigations by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) which he further claimed was instigated by his successor in office, Governor Emeka Ihedioha, Senator Okorocha said the incumbent Imo state governor was only chasing shadows. According to him: “I have thrown a challenge to any bank who feels that I have borrowed money from it on behalf of Imo state to come and contradict me.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
