The ongoing killings and destruction of properties of Nigerians and other Africans living in South Africa should be reported to the United Nations by the Federal Government before it becomes a precarious situation that may lead to war between the two countries.  I believe those killing Nigerians are being sponsored to do so by some powerful South Africans. The Christian leaders in South African have been attacking the South African president because of the way he is handling the situation; he is taking it with kid gloves while he is expected to take solid steps. He didn’t bother to apologise to the country and family members of the slain victims. The problem has worsened and he needs to put an end to this and bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to book, his attitude at present is not helpful. Who are these bandits? Xenophobia: Shall we face  the stark reality? Buhari’s call for investment and burden of insecurity On bad roads One thing President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to do at this crucial time is to take a decisive action on South Africa by reporting the nation to the United Nations to call them to order. It is also therefore instructive to suggest that Nigeria should count their losses and forward them to the United Nations. This is the time to end the killings.  Jimoh Mumin Esq. Ibadan.
