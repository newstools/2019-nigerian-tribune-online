I am not in support of the             Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji for his disapproval of the coronet obas put in place by the immediate past governor of Oyo State just because he wants to maintain status. The intention of the former governor was to streamline custom and tradition to suit modern trend. This the Oba and his supporters vehemently opposed. A nation, people with no staying power Community policing and major causes of insecurity Building better vocational centres Killing of Ondo professor condemnable If not for modernisation, how did Ibadan get a crowned oba instead of baale? How come the Alaafin of Oyo no longer sends his chief slave, Ilari, to Ibadan to put iyeye leaf on the head of a new baale? How come the oba became His Royal Majesty?  08173934247 SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE
