The Federal High Court on Tuesday convicted two students for internet fraud in Abuja. The convicts are Adefemi Dare and Adeyemi Olugbenga, 400-level Mechanical Engineering and Political Science students respectively of Ekiti State University, Ekiti. The students were convicted after pleading guilty to fraud. The EFCC alleged that Dare, some time ago in Ekiti fraudulently impersonated Brian Watkins of the U.S. with intent to obtain property. The EFCC also alleged that Olugbenga fraudulently impersonated an American known as Paul Edwin to extort the sum of N500,000 from a victim who resides in the US.
