THE member representing Ijebu Central Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Korede Osunsanya has vowed to appeal against the judgement of the Ogun State National and State House of Assembly Elections Petition Tribunal that nullified his election. The lawmaker in a statement by his media office made available to Tribune Online in Abeokuta, urged his constituents to remain calm, saying he was unperturbed with the verdict of the tribunal.

The honourable member said he believed in the judiciary as the final arbiter and that he would pursue all legal means to see the case to a logical conclusion. “I’m not deterred by the outcome of the tribunal verdict as I will file an appeal in court. There is nothing to fear. There is no cause for alarm from any quarter. I implore all my supporters to be calm and patient as the law would soon take its course,” the lawmaker assured.
