SENATOR representing Borno South senatorial district, Mohammed Ali Ndume has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the president’s victory on Wednesday at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal. The Justices in a unanimous judgment read by Justice Mohammed Garba dismissed the petition by the Peoples Democratic Party and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in its entirety, saying they failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Ndume in a statement he personally signed described the victory as deserving. Senator Ndume said the tribunal verdict vindicated millions of Nigerians whom he noted had advised Atiku Abubakar not to go to court to challenge Buhari’s victory at the poll.
