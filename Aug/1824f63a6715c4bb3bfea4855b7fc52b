The Plateau High Court on Wednesday ordered that a 37-year-old woman, Adeyola Afonja, who allegedly beat her eight-year-old daughter to death for stealing N350, be remanded in prison custody. The police charged Afonja, who resides in Etobaba Village, Jos North, with culpable homicide, an offence punishable with death if found guilty. Justice S.P Gang, gave the order after the visibly distraught mother pleaded not guilty to the charge stating that she only wanted to correct her child. Justice Gang adjourned the case until Oct 8, for the continuation of hearing and to enable her to get legal representation.
