The source further disclosed that the victim was conversant with Ibrahim, and said this made it possible for him to convince and lure her to a corner of a building, where he succeeded in defiling her. However, when the matter became public knowledge, a relative of the suspect, said to be an Immigration officer, was allegedly trying to use his influence to sweep the case under the carpet.
