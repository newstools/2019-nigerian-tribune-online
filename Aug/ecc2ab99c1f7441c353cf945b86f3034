The Chairman of the Society of Nigerian Artists, Lagos State Chapter, Mr Idowu Sonaya, has said that the penalty meted out to culprits of piracy should be commensurated with the severity of the offense committed. Sonaya, an artist and sculptor, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lagos that there was need for government to review some clauses in the Nigerian Copyright Law concerning piracy. NAN reports that Sonaya have prominent artworks in public places in Lagos, including the statue of Alhaja Abibatu Mogaji at Oyingbo Market.

It has to be looked into and the necessary redress sought,” he said. Sonaya noted that the Nigerian Copyright Commission should not be a toothless dog. “Piracy in the visual arts sector is what we are trying to check as a professional body. “Even if you must copy, you must identify works that do not belong to you; make sure you request permission from the owner,” Sonaya said.
