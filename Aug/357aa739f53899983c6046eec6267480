Edokpolor argued that the ongoing feud between the governor and his predecessor has now made most politicians in the state to sit on the fence due to lack of pragmatic and sincere leadership. He added: “We have it on good authority that the so-called leader is trying hard to secure the trust of APC National Working Committee in order to be considered for the 2020 gubernatorial ticket having been allegedly deprived of it in 2016.” Persistent attempts to reach Ogie on his mobile phone proved futile as his line was engaged.
