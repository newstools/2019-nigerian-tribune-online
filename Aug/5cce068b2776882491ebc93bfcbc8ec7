The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop what the PDP described as the governing party’s shadow-boxing and rather address the alleged failures of President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement issued in Abuja on Monday by Kola Ologbondiyan, its National Publicity Secretary, the main opposition said rather than always seeking to politicize important national issues, the APC should assist President Buhari in providing answers to his alleged failures, including the crippling of the nation’s economy and the erosion of the national cohesion, which it said have resulted in resentment across the nation.

PDP, therefore, demanded that APC come clean on the ignoble roles it was playing in undermining the national integrity and efforts towards a stable polity. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
