Samuel Olukunle Ojo, the Chief of Staff (CoS) to the former governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, has debunked online news in circulation that his house in Epe, was on Tuesday raided by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), describing the report as untrue as he did not have a house in Epe area of the state. Ojo said this in a statement by his media aide, Cornelius Kayode, declaring that the house raided in Epe did not belong to him. He added: “Mr Kunle Ojo did not have any personal house in Epe.” BREAKING: Deputy governor escapes death as robbers kill 3… Nigerians rank fifth among African students in Germany #EndSARS: [VIRAL VIDEO] SARS operatives shoot dead suspected… 12th African Games: Nigerian beach volleyballers lose to… ALSO READ: Collapsed bridge: ATBU reopens after two weeks of closure Kayode maintained that the house raided by the EFCC operatives belonged to Mr Bunmi Ariyo, who was the Personal Assistant (PA) to the immediate past Governor of Lagos State. “The former CoS doesn’t have a house in Epe as claimed by online news today.
