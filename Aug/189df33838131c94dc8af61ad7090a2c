I am a 35 year old Civil Servant. A week after attending a camp meeting where I slept on an old camp bed, I started itching all over my body. The itching is worst at night.  Kindly let me know the cause of this and what I can do about it. Thanks. My grandpa’s dementia Can I remove my womb? Is this gonorrhoea? Is this a drug reaction?

In view of this, you will benefit from a proper physical examination by your doctor who will also send samples of your blood and skin scrapings to the Laboratory for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. If it is confirmed that what you have is an infectious skin disease, your beddings and towels should also be disinfected to avoid a recurrence and spread to other members of your household.
