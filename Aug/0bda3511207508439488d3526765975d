Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly, says the All Progressives Congress (APC) will rule Nigeria beyond 2023 as President Muhammadu Buhari is laying a solid foundation for the party and the country. Abdullahi stated this on Wednesday in his country home, Umaisha, Nasarawa State, while fielding questions from newsmen. He added that Buhari would complete his eight years in 2023 and “by then he would have laid a solid foundation for the country and the party. “By the end of President Buhari’s tenure, I assure you he will have already laid a solid foundation for the party, the country and whoever is coming will follow his footstep. “Buhari is one person that will not like to impose anybody on Nigerians in 2023. “We are going to assess individual basis and it is going to be based on integrity so that whoever can enter Buhari’s shoes, we will go for him. “So, I can assure you that in fact, APC will survive beyond 2023, there is no doubt about it,” he said.
