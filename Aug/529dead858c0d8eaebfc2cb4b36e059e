I am a 27 year old married man with three children. Recently, my wife complained that anytime we have fun, she will be scratching her private part. I also have the same feeling when cleaning up after sex with her. I even have some pimples on my penis. What can be the cause of this problem and how do we handle it? Coughing and vomitting Smoking and public health Pregnancy after a caesarean Can we try acupuncture? Prince (by SMS)  You did not indicate whether or not the itching comes after the use of a condom since some condoms usually cause allergy to their users. If condoms are not involved, then the likely cause of your problem will be a fungal infection. This can be confirmed by subjecting a vaginal swab from your wife to a detailed Laboratory investigation. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, adequate treatment for both of you will clear the infection. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
