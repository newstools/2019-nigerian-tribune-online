Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti on Thursday performed the swearing-in for the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, as the new Chairman of the state’s Traditional Council in spite of the court action instituted by other members of the Council. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Alabi’s appointment is being challenged at a State High Court in Ado Ekiti by 17 traditional rulers who are aggrieved over the appointment. NAN reports that Fayemi, who did not dwell on the suit while inaugurating Alabi, charged  the new chairman to “unite the traditional institution and eschew baseless rivalry.” He said the time had come for traditional rulers in the country to bring their influence to bear, to resolve the vicious security challenge across the country. While emphasising the need to maintain security and peaceful co-existence in their domains  Fayemi said their cooperation would help in curbing anti-social activities by strengthening partnership with government. He said the reconstitution of the council was inevitable,  judging by the fact that traditional rulers play pivotal roles in the stability of every community and the nation in general.

Responding, Alabi promised to be fair to all the monarchs regardless of status, urging his colleagues to restrict themselves to giving advice to governors and not to criticise “since we are not running a labour union.” ” We can’t afford any form of antagonism and bickering as we are not in competition with the governor. “We are an advisory body in line with the law that established this council. We assure Mr Governor of our unalloyed loyalty to be able to move Ekiti forward,” he said. Alabi was appointed on Aug. 1 following the expiration of the tenure of the Oloye of Ote Oye Ekiti, Oba Oluwole Ademolaju, on July 31 SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
