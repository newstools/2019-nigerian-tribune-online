The Elections Petition Tribunal sitting in Yola, the capital city of Adamawa State on Wednesday dismissed the suit filed by Muktar Kabiru of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), seeking to nullify the election of Hon. Abdulrazak Namdas as a member representing Mayo-Belwa, Jada, Ganye, Toungo in the House of Representatives. Justice S. Akinbiyi in his ruling argued that the petitioner’s case lacks merit as all evidence could not be substantiated. The judge, therefore, asked all the parties to bear the legal cost of their suits.
