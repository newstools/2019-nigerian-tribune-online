The Attorney General of Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) on Thursday said individuals and corporate organisation responsible for the underhand-dealings that resulted in the award of $9 billion damages against Nigeria by a British court will be dealt with. The court had ruled that the Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&ID) had the right to seize $9 billion in Nigerian assets. Malami, who said the federal government will appeal the judgment of the British court, explained that the dispute that led to the arbitration between the Nigerian government and P&PID which consequently resulted in the said court ruling arose from a 20 years Gas Supply Processing Agreement (GSPA) purportedly entered with P&ID by past administration in 2010, which contract P&ID never performed as agreed.
