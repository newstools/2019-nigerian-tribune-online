The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has charged the management and staff of the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture to work harder to justify the confidence of President Muhammadu Buhari. The Minister, who made the remarks in Abuja on Wednesday at his inaugural meeting with the Permanent Secretary and directors of the ministry immediately after he was sworn in by the President, said his re-appointment and subsequent posting to the ministry is a mark of the confidence reposed in him by the President. “My charge to all of us is to please redouble our effort so that we can justify the confidence Mr President has reposed in us. That Mr President has reappointed and posted me back to this ministry is a measure of the confidence he has in me. So I think we all need to work hard.
