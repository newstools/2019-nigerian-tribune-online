The Yobe Governor Mai Mala Buni says his administration will reconstruct public infrastructures destroyed by the insurgency to facilitate resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected communities. He gave the assurance while flagging off the reconstruction of a four-kilometre township road with eight-kilometre drainage in Buni Yadi on Wednesday. The governor said the N673.4 million road would be constructed through direct labour to ease movement of persons, goods and services while the drainage would check flooding in the town.

Buni directed the acting Secretary to the state government to liaise with the Victims Support Fund who started but abandoned work on the General Hospital Buni Yadi. “You should establish from the Victims Support Fund what are the factors militating against completion of the hospital and,  if there are challenges that would slow down its completion, the government would rehabilitate the facility for the benefit of our people,” he said. According to the governor, the state government will also rehabilitate the vandalized electricity and schools in the affected areas. “We will construct modern markets in Buni Yadi, Ngalda, Potiskum, Giedam, Gashua, Nguru and Damaturu to enhance trade and commerce to improve the economy of the state,” he said.
