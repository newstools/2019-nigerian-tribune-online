THE International Youths Coalition for Education (IYCE), an NGO, has called for a paradigm shift from conventional education to alternative education for a knowledge-based economy in Nigeria. Mr Gideon Olarenwaju, the Founder of the coalition, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Friday. Olarenwaju said that it was time to take the millions of “out of school children’’ in Nigeria out of the streets with alternative education.

The IYCE leader called on governments at all levels to support alternative education for a greater Nigeria. According to him, there are many in the conventional classroom without knowledge of what the teacher is teaching. He said that qualified personnel for teaching was imperative for knowledge enhancement and innovations. NAN reports that alternative education is an educational programme or system that is separate from a mainstream educational system and that is designed especially for students with academic or behavioural difficulties.
