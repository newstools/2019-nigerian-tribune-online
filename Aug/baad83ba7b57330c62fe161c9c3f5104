THE Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, resumed at the ministry with a strong warning to all the agencies under the ministry as well as the staff to desist from budget padding or face serious sanction. He warned all agencies to desist from such act as serious and heavy sanction would be inflicted on any of them that further indulges in it. To ensure adherence to this, he instructed that all the agencies and departments in the ministry must hold their regular scheduled meetings. #PMBInJapan: Buhari arrives for 7th Tokyo International Conference in… Ugboaja emerges NLC scribe Brace up for the challenges ahead  —TUC, ULC tell Ngige FG to enroll newspaper vendors in N-Power programme Nigeria’s Labour Ministry very weak — ILO He pointed out that there are financial regulations which they must follow strictly, and instructed that the agencies must submit their budget to to his ofice and be ready to defend it.

Part of doing our own part is that the agencies must submit their  own budget here and they must come to defend it; because there is budget padding.” He added: “We want to start operating January to December budget circle and the National Assembly has requested from us for budget to come in September. Once they get it in September, they will give it back to us in December.” He said his second coming is to consolidate what was done before, adding that bringing him back to the ministry was an endorsement.
