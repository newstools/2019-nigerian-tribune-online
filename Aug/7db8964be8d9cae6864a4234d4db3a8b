AN Ibadan, Oyo State-based cleric, Alhaji Ibraheem Bamidele, has urged the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the state to always appoint leaders in the mould of its late chairman, Alhaji Taofeek Oyerinde (Fele). Alhaji Bamidele, popularly known as Baba l’Amunigun, made the plea at the first remembrance prayer orgainsed for the deceased at his residence in Ibadan. The cleric said the transport union in the state required a leader like Fele for the sustenance of the peaceful conduct of its activities. “Everybody will taste death one day but the most important thing is: how will people describe you after your demise?

I saw him as a godsend,” the cleric said. The prayer, which was organised by Alhaji Tirimisiriyu Adeniji Olowoposi, was graced by people from all walks of life, especially members of the union in the state. Oyerinde died on August 21, 2018.
