THE National Youth Service Corps ((NYSC) has banned corps members from driving vehicles belonging to religious groups to further ensure their safety. It also ordered that all vehicles belonging to religious groups in NYSC must be parked at the State Secretariat under the control of the State Coordinator. The NYSC Director-General, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim gave the order during his visit to corps members having their orientation exercise at Government Science Secondary School, Batagarawa, Katsina. He said: “Corps members are no longer allowed to drive vehicles that belong to religious groups. They should engage the services of professional drivers. We cannot afford to lose any corps members to road accidents.” PDP, APGA governors back re-appointment of Ngige as Labour… Lagos-Ibadan rail: Amaechi seeks more money to build bridges… $9bn judgement debt: Solicitor General absolves staff of… NHRC condemns illegal detention of 40 Nigerians by Navy ALSO READ: Fight over #FBIList tears Nigerians apart as #IgboYahooBoys, #YorubaDrugDealers, #ArewaDrugDealers trend on Twitter He said such vehicles will be under control of the State Coordinator who will release them on request to safeguard corps members from road accidents.
