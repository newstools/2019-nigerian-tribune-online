Following the outcry of the Leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky that he is being maltreated in India, the Nigerian government had said that the IMN leader has an ulterior motive. In a statement signed by the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Information and Culture  Dcns. Grace Isu Gekpe, El-Zakzaky had been exhibiting a character which had slowed down his medical attention. Against the standard medical practice and condition of his visa, she said El-Zazzaky had demanded free movement and access to visitors of all kinds as well as he requested to be allowed to check into a 5-Star hotel instead of being admitted in the hospital, which he was refused on the ground that he came into the country for medicals and not as a tourist, more so that his visa was issued on medical grounds and not for tourism. The statement reads: “The Court on 5th August 2019 granted Sheikh Ibraheem EL-Zakzaky leave to travel to India for medical treatment.  Consequently, the Government and its relevant agencies took steps to comply with the Order. “In line with the Court Order, El-Zakzaky was approved to embark on the trip with State officials and his choice to be accompanied by his aides and personal Doctors was not opposed by the government. “On 12th August 2019, he and other members of the entourage went to India via Dubai. It is to be noted that El-Zakzaky particularly chose Medanta Hospital, India. However, on reaching Dubai, El-Zakzaky began to display ulterior motives against laid down procedures”. The statement further noted “he requested that his passport be handed over to him but the State officials would not budge to his pressure. The situation became worse in India as he refused to subject himself to preliminary medical checks. “In addition, he demanded free movement and access to visitors of all kinds as well as requested to be allowed to check into a 5-Star Hotel instead of being admitted in the hospital. The request was refused on the ground that he came into the country for medicals and not as a tourist (more so that his Visa was issued on medical grounds and not for tourism). He also demanded that Police protection be withdrawn from him by the Indian authorities. “Against medical ethics and standard practice, he requested to nominate Doctors of his choice to join the ones tasked by Medanta Hospital to perform medical treatment on him and his wife. This created a stalemate, which the Hospital insisted that he would not dictate to it on the choice of medical personnel to carry the required medical treatment”. The government, however, said “frustrated by his antics, the Indian authorities have expressed willingness to return him to Nigeria with immediate effect. This is on the account that they will not allow him to use their country to internationalize his group’s activities. “Against this background, the Nigerian government wishes to commend the stand of the Indian Government as well as apologize to her for the unruly behaviour of El-Zakzaky. Similarly, the attention of the public and indeed the international community is hereby drawn to these unfortunate developments. “The government also wishes to use this opportunity to affirm its readiness to undertake the prosecution of El-Zakzaky through the due process if and when he is returned to the country. On this note, his foul cry that he is being held in circumstances worse than he was in Nigeria should be disregarded”. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
