Malam Mele Kyari, the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said the corporation has begun repair of its damaged Abura Crude Trunkline. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Abura Crude Trunk line at Otu-Jeremi town in Delta experienced an eruption on Friday. Kyari, who gave the assurance on Saturday in Benin shortly after he tee-off at the 2019 (NNPC) upstream golf tournament, said the repair would be completed in three days. “It wasn’t an explosion, it was an eruption on our pipeline, our team has moved to the site and in three days we are going to fix it. “We have curtailed the spill that is coming out, so its not an explosion but an eruption because there was no fire in the place.
