He, however, noted that the number of candidates involved in various forms of malpractice in 2019 increased with 40,630 cases recorded as against 20,181 cases recorded in 2018. Gana explained that the reason for the increase in detection of malpractice was not unconnected with the deployment of biometric verification devices during the 2019 SSCE exercise. The Registrar also slammed sanctions on three schools in Kebbi, Oyo, and Katsina over various infractions committed during the examination “Arising from the above, three schools one each in Katsina, Kebbi and Oyo states were recommended for de-recognition for two years for their involvement in mass cheating involving whole centre cases. “Also, a total of eighteen supervisors were blacklisted for various offences ranging from poor supervision, aiding and abetting, connivance with non-candidates and so on. “In line with council’s zero tolerance for any form of examination malpractice, members of staff alleged to have behaved contrary to expectations are to face appropriate disciplinary measures once they fail to satisfactorily defend themselves,” he said.
