He added that removing waste in drainages would prevent breeding sites for mosquitoes which often cause malaria. He urged the public to prevent stagnant water in their environment by avoiding blockage of water channels. Ossai stressed that sleeping under insecticide-treated net also helps in preventing mosquito bite and malaria. “Insecticide-treated net is important for both adults and children as this is another way by which malaria can be prevented,” he said.
