THERE is the need for Muslims to carefully evaluate their lives from time to time so as to be able to increase their God-consciousness and feel grateful for blessings that might be previously unnoticed. This was the consensus of clerics at a prayer/thanksgiving session held, last weekend, in Ibadan, Oyo State, to celebrate the 70th birthday of Alhaja Hussainat Kehinde Subair Abdullahi, wife of Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, the national coordinator of the Muslim Media Watch Group of Nigeria (MMWGN).

According to one of them, Alhaji Bada, Muslims must be discerning and appreciative of the countless blessings and mercies of Allah amidst the vicissitude of life as they advance in age and ultimately see to it that they smoothen their relationships with God. Describing the day of a person’s birth as significant, the clerics congratulated Alhaja Subair Abdullahi on attaining the age of 70 and urged her to live out the rest of her years in increased piety and service to humanity.
