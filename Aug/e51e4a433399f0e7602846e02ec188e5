I am due to deliver my first baby in a few months time and my doctors have suggested a Caesarean Section operation because of the baby’s position. I am really terrified of an operation and will do everything possible to avoid it. Your kind advice will be appreciated. Ijeoma (by SMS) Is this my baby? Are sex toys safe? I fart too much My husband is too large Caesarean Sections are usually prescribed when normal delivery will expose both the mother and baby to some degree of risk. When carried out by expert hands, the procedure is very safe and there is little or nothing to fear. However, since the reason for the CS is your baby’s current position, the baby could still change to a position where natural delivery may be possible in a few weeks time. In this wise, a repeat Pelvic Scan should still be carried out before the time of the planned surgery.   SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
