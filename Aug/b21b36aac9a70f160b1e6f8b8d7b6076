The Police Command in Enugu State has described as false the kidnap alarm raised by a father, Mr Frank Anioma, over his daughter, Miss Kosisochukwu Anioma. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Ebere Amaraizu, said this in a statement on Saturday in Enugu. Amaraizu said the missing girl, Kosisochukwu, was found in Owerri, the Imo State capital, in her boyfriend’s house. The police spokesperson said Kosisochukwu’s father, Anioma, had taken to the social media to announce his daughter’s kidnap as well as reported to the police. Amaraizu said that the fake kidnap alarm was raised on August 22 after which the police operatives of the Anti-Kidnap Unit immediately swung into action. He said that contrary to the fake social media hype, fresh facts had emerged on the purported fake kidnapping incident.
