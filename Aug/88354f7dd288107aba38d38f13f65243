The Ondo State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mr Femi Agagu, has stressed the need for government institutions to maintain a good relationship with their host communities. Agagu stated this on Friday while on a visit to Oyemekun Grammar School, Akure, following a report that the school’s activities were posing health hazards to residents of the area. He said that he was in the school to see the extent of encroachment to its land by the neighbouring communities and to determine if there was any health hazard to the people in the neighbourhood.

Speaking on the school’s piggery project, the commissioner commended those who initiated it and directed the principal to come up with a proposal on how to create a profitable venture out of it. Earlier, the principal said that the idea of piggery was muted by the school authorities over 40 years ago, saying that the project did not pose any health hazard to the school’s neighbours. “Many of those complaining that our piggery project is posing a health hazard to them have encroached on the school’s land but we have allowed peace to reign, all in the spirit of good neighbourliness,” he said.
