The position held by Nteranya Sanginga, director-general of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), that a double-digit investment in the agricultural sector backed by a vibrant rural infrastructural network will help states in Nigeria to accelerate the transformation of agriculture really indicated the future of the agricultural sector. In 2003, African heads of state in Maputo made a commitment to invest at least 10 per cent of their annual budgets in agriculture. Sixteen years after the declaration, only a few countries have implemented it. Making reference to the Oyo State agricultural policy framework, the IITA boss said that Oyo State’s investment in agriculture had nosedived from about seven per cent to two per cent from 1995 to 2017, adding that the new administration needs to reverse the trend.

Nigeria has a lot to benefit from huge investment in the agricultural sector. All levels of government and private individuals, including organisations, must be ready to invest in this sector. Agriculture remains the future, just as technology continues to guarantee development. Toyin Adejuwon, Ibadan. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
