I had a Caesarean operation in February due to Fibroid and miscarriage. I missed my period last month. Can I carry the pregnancy? Will I be able to deliver by myself? What should I do sir?

Mrs C O (by SMS)  It is generally advisable for women to wait 18 to 24 months after they’ve given birth before trying to conceive again.  This is especially true for those who’ve delivered by caesarean section. It is believed that this period will allow the body a chance to heal and recover from surgery. Research shows that getting pregnant less than six months after a c-section can increase your risk of complications like a ruptured uterus or having a low birth weight baby during your next pregnancy. Now that you are pregnant just about 6 months after your last delivery, you will need to be closely monitored by your doctor so as to have a healthy baby. The doctor will also decide if it is safe to allow you to deliver by yourself or to offer you another Caesarean section. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
