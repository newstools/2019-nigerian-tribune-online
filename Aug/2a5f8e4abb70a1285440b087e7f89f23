Adibe said that the Digital Anatomy Laboratory would be named after Offor, as a memorial, so that generations to come would know that the laboratory was actually equipped by him. “We resolved in our Faculty that anyone that comes to our aid, we shall name the project after the person and we are thrilled by this gesture,’’ he said. In his reaction, Dean, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prof. Amaechi Atama, thanked Offor in ensuring that the project becomes a reality. Atama said: “Sir Emeka Offor has taken the lead, and we hope that others like him should follow suit.’’ NAN recalls that Offor, who is also the Chairman of Chrome Group, is also a globally recognised philanthropist that had donated millions of dollars towards the eradication of Polio.
