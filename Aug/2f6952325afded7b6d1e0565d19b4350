More than 200 migrants were rescued on Wednesday by the Spanish coastguard as they attempted to make the crossing from Africa to Spain, rescue services said on Thursday. The rescue comes at a time when Spain is preparing for the arrival on a Spanish warship of 15 migrants from an Italian port following a prolonged standoff between Italian authorities and a Spanish-registered private rescue boat, Reuters reported. On Thursday, the coastguard said the migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa were found in three rafts in the Alboran Sea, between northeastern Morocco and southeastern Spain on Wednesday afternoon. 6.4-magnitude earthquake strikes off US coast Apple to unveil iPhone 11 September 10th UN agency urges US to reinstate funds to protect women Trump to block military aid to Ukraine They were taken to Almeria and Malaga, the coastguard added.
