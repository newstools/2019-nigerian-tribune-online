Ex BBNaija housemate, Gedoni Ekpata says he thinks housemate, Mercy Eke is playing the best game. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Gedoni shared his thoughts on fellow housemates’ strategies in an interview with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, host of the show. According to him, he likes Mercy’s game and looking back, he would like a woman to win the 2019 season. When asked by Ebuka who was the worst game player, Gedoni, who had earlier predicted that Mike might win the season, said that he feels Seyi Awolowo has the worst game. He said, “Seyi is playing the worst game. I don’t know but Seyi is not giving himself. “He is not putting himself out there as much as he should. That’s what I think but I will vote for him anytime, any day.
