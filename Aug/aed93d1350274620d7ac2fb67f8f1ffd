Gana explained that in line with the Council’s zero tolerance for any form of examination malpractice; members of staff alleged to have behaved contrary to expectations, would face appropriate disciplinary measures once they failed to satisfy the board. “This is in line with the tradition of NECO. Last year all those who compromised were made to face disciplinary committee to defend themselves,” he said. He stated that the board achieved that feat as a result of broad-based monitoring of the examination, procurement of the state- of- the- art of biometric Verification device, and introduction of full biometrics during the last SSCE. “The council procured 20 new vehicles for improved logistics and prompt service delivery, repositioning of NECO ICT for effective result delivery amongst others,” he said. The registrar then called on candidates to access the approved NECO Website: www.NECO.gov.ng only, while warning candidates and parents against the activities of fraudsters. “NECO has abolished the use of cards in all its operations as every transaction is now 100 per cent online, ” he said.
