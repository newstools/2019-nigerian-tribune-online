The speaker of the Oyo State House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, has reacted to suggestions that the Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Bill 2019 is an attempt by the legislative arm to undermine the economic activities of the Fulani across the state. According to Honourable Ogundoyin, the bill is meant to regulate the activities of herders in the state and was never intended to make life and business unbearable for the Fulani in the state. Ogundoyin said: “The Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Bill 2019 before the 9th Oyo Assembly is significantly meant to regulate the activities of herders in Oyo State in the area of grazing and rearing of livestock.

The speaker called on all Fulani and herders in the state to continue with their business activities without fear, encouraging them to be ready to abide by the provisions of the bill when it fully becomes operational. He said that the bill, which had passed its second reading, was legislated to expose the fake and criminally-minded people who hide under the guise of herders or livestock owners to perpetrate evil, especially kidnapping and other heinous crimes.
