The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Wednesday, expressed shock at the judgment of the Supreme Court on the Presidential election petition filed by the party and its Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. This was contained in a statement made available to newsmen by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan. According to the statement, ” indeed, what we witnessed today was not what majority of Nigerians, who participated and observed the Presidential election expected; and this includes even members of the APC”. The Party noted that it indeed made a solid case, with indisputable evidence, showing that Atiku Abubakar won the Presidential election and as such was surprised that the justices of the Supreme Court held otherwise; however, that was the highest court of the land.
