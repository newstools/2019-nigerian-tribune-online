The Federal Government has promised its full support to make the hosting of the 2019 All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA) a success, as the country prepares to host the glamorous event in Lagos from November 20 to 23, 2019, with the theme: Feel Africa. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the promise in a statement in Lagos on Sunday. According to Mohammed ‘’When you look at the All Africa Music Awards, it’s one of the biggest awards for the music industry in Africa and what government had done in the past was to provide the enabling environment for the awards to take place. “We provided support services for AFRIMA, we gave them the backing they needed and I think it’s on record that the AFRIMA editions that have been held in Nigeria have been among the most successful.

He said part of the reasons Nigeria has successfully hosted the musi  awards is because the country has relaxed its visa regime, with the visa on arrival policy, thus making it easier for people to come in. AFRIMA, which was first held in 2014, was established in collaboration with the African Union (AU) to reward and celebrate musical talents and creativity in Africa as well as to promote African Cultural Heritage.
