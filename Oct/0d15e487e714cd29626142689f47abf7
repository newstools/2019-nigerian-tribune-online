Yunusa Ibrahim, “the management of WACT has written to us, complaining that agents have not been coming to pick their containers. Less than 30percent of agents have been coming to clear their containers at the facility, thereby over-flooding the facility with overtime containers. “Due to this situation, the WACT management has been forced to convert their car parks and container examination bay to storage of overtime containers. The WACT management said they had to go to this length just to make sure vessels are not diverted away from the facility. “The WACT facility has been filled up. There are currently about 1,500 containers that have been examined but have still not been taken out of the terminal. There are a lot of overtime containers in the facility, taken up close to 90percent of space inside the facility. “I have spoken to the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarders in Nigeria (CRFFN), I have spoken to the Nigerian Customs Service about the situation at WACT.
