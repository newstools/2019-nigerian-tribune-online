The Federal Government, on Wednesday, disclosed plans to expend the sum of N4.88 trillion for payment of the new national minimum wage and other personnel costs in the 2020 fiscal year. Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, who disclosed this during the National budget public hearing on the 2020 budget estimates at the joint session held at the instance of the Senate and House of Representatives, informed the lawmakers of the present administration’s projected investment of N10.33 trillion into Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs/Bilateral/Multilateral project tied loans/expenditures). President Muhammadu Buhari had on October 8 unveiled the 2020 Budget proposal before a joint session of the National Assembly. For the proposed budget deficit for 2020 was pegged at N2.175 trillion (1.52% of the GDP), is expected to be funded mainly by borrowing of N1.594 trillion, comprising of N744.99 billion domestic sources and N850 billion foreign sources (more concessionary financing against commercial financing arrangement).

Mrs Ahmed who affirmed that the country achieved 58% of its revenue target as at second quarter of 2019 fiscal year, explained that the success was largely because some one-off items such as the N10 billion from Oil Joint Venture Asset restructuring and N320 billion from revision of the Oil Production Sharing Contract legislation/terms are yet to be actualised.

Mrs. Ahmed who expressed concern over the rising personnel cost including pension costs above N3 trillion, however, noted that steps are being taken to “contain the rising personnel costs, including an October 2019 deadline by Mr. President for all MDAs to implement IPPIS.” As contained in the 2020 budget estimates, the Minister explained that MDAs are to roll over 60% of the 2019 projects due to paucity of fund in the current year. In his opening remarks at the two-day event, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan said the successful implementation of the nation’s annual budget depends on increased awareness of its citizens. “The importance of the Budget proposal in national development cannot, therefore, be overemphasized. This is the reason why inputs have to be all-inclusive as we are now set to do. “We understand that the Budget proposal is about the fiscal target, resource allocation, public expenditure policy, productivity and efficiency. We also understand that the process is one of passage, mobilisation and execution. “For them to work well however, we have to have increased participation which also amounts to empowerment in the realm of information, awareness and education. “An improved understanding most times comes through the exchange of ideas. It comes in a process of agreement and disagreement. Better awareness or expansion of thoughts could also come through purposeful interactions. “Other than this is the fact that public hearing is a legislative tool of participation. Through it, we engage with critical stakeholders and the public, either separately or collectively.” In his short remarks, Chairman, House Committee on Appropriation, Hon. Muktar Betara, explained that the public hearing was aimed at making it an all-inclusive process in the task of national development. “As always, the enormity of demands translated to projects and huge capital can hardly match available resources. This is the more reason why we in the National Assembly and particularly in the House of Representatives will always do our utmost best in thoroughly processing the national budget. “The 2020 Budget of ‘sustaining growth and job creation’ is no doubt built within robust and sound objectives, which if well programmed, will translate to effective implementation and dividends that will spiral growth across all sections and spheres of the country. “We are also committed to working in line with this vision and inspiration.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
