I recently went to the village and saw my 50 year old Uncle who has had a deep sore on his left ankle for the past 5 years in spite of all kinds of treatments at the local Health Centre. He also used some native herbs because of the belief that the sore was caused by witchcraft. Kindly let me know what could be his problem.

You’re an animal, judge tells Chrisland School ex-supervisor, jailed 60 years for defiling toddler Your Uncle’s leg sore (Ulcer) could be due to many reasons such as poor blood circulation to the affected leg, diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), heart disease, high cholesterol, kidney disease, increased pressure in the legs, varicose veins, smoking and infections. The odds of developing leg ulcers increase with age, and they’re often hereditary. However, your Uncle will benefit from a comprehensive medical examination to determine the real cause of his problem as well as the appropriate treatment. Since this kind of facility may not be available in the village, you may need to take him to a Specialist or Teaching Hospital nearest to you. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
