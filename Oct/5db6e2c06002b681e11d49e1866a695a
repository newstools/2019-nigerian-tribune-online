A serving member of National Youth Service  Corps (NYSC) serving in Bebeji local government area of Kano state, has allegedly beaten a young boy (Almajjiri boy )to death. This is just as policemen had barricaded the area to prevent residents of the area from attacking the corps member. However, the sad incident according to a source occurred on Thursday evening, when the boy rushed into the corps members’ lodge to collect fruits from the residents who had developed the simple gesture of giving out fruits to children in the area.
