EDO State Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Mohammed has debunked reports that kidnappers of Albert Eguavoen, the Divisional Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Irrua area of the state demanded a ransom of N6million demanded for his release. Mohammed who spoke on Tuesday in Benin disclosed that a combined team of security agencies in the state was being put in place to apprehend the abductors. Eguavoen and another officer of the corps, Mr. Francis Okunwe, attached to the Area Commander of the Edo North Area Command were kidnapped last Friday, September 27 between the small towns of Ewossa and Ekpon as the duo journeyed to Benin, the Edo State capital. The kidnappers were said to have made the demand after opening negations with relatives of the NSCDC officer. The Edo Police boss, however, said: “The police does not encourage payment of ransom. I am not aware of the demand for N6 million or whatever amount to free the Civil Defence officials. All I can say is that the police is not relenting. We are combing the bush and on top of the situation so that they can be released unhurt.

He did not disclose whether the said ransom as demanded by the captors was for the two operatives. The commandant was also said to have pleaded that his church, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) should intensify prayer to ensure that he is not hurt. The source said: “We fear for the safety of our brother because from the voice of the kidnappers we could deduce that they are herdsmen. “I urge the authorities of NSCDC to intensify efforts to ensure Eguavoen and his colleague safe return,” the relative said. Determined to rescue their officials unhurt, the spokesman for the NSCDC in the state, Mr. Efosa Ogbebor disclosed that his men were not taking the matter lightly as they have despatched men to the two communities where they were allegedly kidnapped. Ogbebor said: “We will comb the forest and ensure that our colleagues are released unhurt.” How premature ejaculation  and small penis almost ruin my marriage and made my wife cheat on me, until my Abuja doctor recommend this powerful but simple solution that work wonder...DONT BE A VICTIM....
