Corruption charges against Osinbajo and possibly President Muhammadu Buhari, hardly look real or believable but ridiculous, and mischievous in the court of public opinion. I can’t say that the two personalities are not capable of wrong, mistake, weakness or compromise, especially in our nation that such “lapses or shortcomings” are almost inevitable as norms for source of strength, honour, respect and influence. The reason the president and VP have not been ‘suitable’ or fit to accuse for corruption accusation is because of past experiences. We had a Vice President in this country that almost claimed all key appointments of government officials through contracts, properties and made elected officials wild with power, ambition and wealth in order to buy their loyalty and make them despise his boss. And, there was a  time money was freely dispensed to lawmakers to manipulate issues. These are the reasons  make them the present leaders seen as saints compared to their predecessors.
