No fewer than 20, 000 youths are expected to participate in the second edition of Ondo Art Festival scheduled for December, Mr Sheyi Oshodi, the Chief Executive Officer of Oshodi Art Gallery has said. Oshodi, a major stakeholder in the event, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Akure, described arts and culture as one of the pivots of any society “as it revolves around the vitality of the youths and engages them positively.” “Ondo State is greatly blessed with rich cultural heritage, highly educated people, an array of entertainment superstars and young talents. “The event has already established the idea of selling and promoting the rich culture, arts, artistes and tourism in many ways and the consequence to the creative industry will be worthwhile. “Ondo Art festival will remain one lasting event for the annual celebration, relaxation-holiday period, and a big business brand for the state and the people. “The ten thousand models for carnival float and special performances this year will be raised from Ondo State, particularly among the youths,” he said.
