FG says no plan to remove fuel subsidy Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolises sugar (glucose) — an important source of fuel for your body. With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — or doesn’t produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Although there’s currently no cure for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease. If diet and exercise aren’t enough to manage your blood sugar well, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy. There is no reason to despair because there are many people who have your kind of ailment and are coping well with it. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
