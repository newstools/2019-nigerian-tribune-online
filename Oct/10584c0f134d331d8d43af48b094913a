This taste is described as unpleasant and can last for a long time until the underlying cause is treated. Poor dental hygiene can also cause a bitter taste in the mouth. It may also cause an increase in cavities, infections, and gum disease or gingivitis. Many common dental issues can be avoided by regularly brushing and flossing the teeth. Some people may also find that using a tongue scraper helps to clear up some symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux may also be the source of an unwanted bitter taste in the mouth. These conditions occur when the muscle or sphincter at the top of the stomach becomes weak and allows acid or bile to rise up into the food pipe. Other causes of bitter mouth taste are stress, anxiety as well as nerve damage to taste buds. You will definitely need a thorough examination by a specialist doctor in order to know the cause and treatment of your complaint. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
