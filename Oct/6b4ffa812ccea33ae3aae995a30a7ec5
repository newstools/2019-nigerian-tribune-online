The University of Ibadan (UI)’s Environmental Health Students Association (EHSA), collaborating with the Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN), has trained a group of secondary school students in Loyola College, Ibadan, on the mitigating and adaptive role of trees towards climate change, and has established a nursery for tree species that will supply seedlings for tree planting. This was done as part of activities marking this year’s World Environment Health Day (WEHD), declared by the International Federation of Environmental Health (IFEH) to hold every September 26.

They have also learnt sustainability of the environment and how to control climate change. If people want to plant trees around here, they can reach out to the school; this will also be a source of revenue for the school.” The Vice-principal, Loyola College and Head of Subject for Agriculture, Mr Sunday Oladipo, said that the school authorities would ensure that nursery is well managed and that membership of the YES club is sustained.
