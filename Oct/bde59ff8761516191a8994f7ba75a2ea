Chocolate City’s Ckay has released the video for his infectious, crowd-pleasing single, entitled: “Way” featuring DJ Lambo, off his sophomore EP, “Ckay the First”. When Ckay’s Way dropped in August; with its fierce in-your-face drums, catchy verses, and ingenious Beethoven interpolation, it was immediately clear that a regular, run-of-the-mill video wouldn’t do the song justice. Fortunately, Ckay has not disappointed, delivering a stellar, charismatic performance in this unorthodox Clarence Peters-directed masterpiece.

Ckayalso introduces audiences to his “Way” dance, which will likely catch on, solely down to how fun and simple it looks. The ever-boisterous DJ Lambo also makes a cameo in the video.
