The Court of Appeal sitting in Akure on Thursday upheld the election of Hon. Bamidele Salam, the lawmaker representing Ede/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It is recalled that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) during the last National Assembly election, Hon Adejare Bello had challenged the declaration of Salam (PDP) as the winner of the election at the elections petitions tribunal. The lower court had in a ruling on 2nd of September, nullified the election of Bamidele Salam after cancelling the results of some units in Ede South, Ede North, Ejigbo and Egbedore as a result of over-voting and also ordered a rerun in the affected units. Salam, however, approached the Court of Appeal seeking the setting aside of judgment that nullified his election.

Adejare Bello also approached the Court of Appeal in a cross-appeal, seeking the total cancellation of the House of Representatives election for the federal constituency. Reacting to the judgment, the Osun State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Hon Soji Adagunodo said “the judiciary has done justice to the matter. They have indeed demonstrated their role as the last hope of the people.” He said “we give thanks to the Almighty God for giving us victory at the Court of Appeal. The judiciary has done justice, considering the unassailable facts. This is commendable.
