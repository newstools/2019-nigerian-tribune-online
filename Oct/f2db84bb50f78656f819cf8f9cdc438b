In his address, Director of the Centre, Professor Chinwe Onwodumogu, said the two research topics were currently on the front burner of societal discourse at all levels because of their negative impact on individuals, families, communities and the larger society. Professor Onwodumogu said sexual abuse and domestic violence leave the perpetrators and their victims bitter, disgruntled, psychologically and socially maladjusted, although the effect on the victim is more devastating.
