The office of the Chief Of Staff to the President has proposed a budget of N13,552,334 to fund honorarium and sitting allowance in the 2020 fiscal year TribuneOnline can report. According to the 2020 Appropriation bill before the national assembly, the amount maintained the highest single budget item for expenditure for the office of the Chief of Staff to the President of Nigeria. This is consistent with the allocation to the office in the currently running budget 2019 where the same figure was approved for the line item with the code  22020301. The amount represents about 75 per cent of the total proposed allocation of N24.557.024 for which the office of the Chief of Staff through the Presidency wanted the approval of the National Assembly for the 2020 budget. Tribune observed that the total proposed budget for 2020 for the office of the Chief of Staff to the President was about N2,615,381 less to the proposed budget for office in 2019.
