The Niger House of Assembly, on Tuesday, decried the disruption of academic activities at the Abubakar Dada Senior Secondary School, Paiko being used as the temporary National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp in the state. The lawmakers made this known during debates on a motion moved by a member representing Paikoro constituency, Suleiman Rabiu, under matters of urgent public importance. “Since the movement of the orientation camp to Paiko, academic activities have always been disrupted at the school, as both the hostels and classrooms are being used by the corps members.

Suleiman said no effort had been made to build a permanent orientation camp despite the acquisition of land for that purpose by the previous administration. The Assembly, therefore, unanimously resolved to invite the permanent secretary of the state ministry of youth development to explain why work had not commenced on the acquired land for the construction of a permanent orientation camp for NYSC.
