The Senate Committee on Power on Tuesday raised concern over N600 million allocated to Electricity Distribution Companies (Disco) by Ministry of Power in 2020 budget. Former Benue State governor and Chairman of the Committee, Senator Gabriel Suswan said it was unconscionable for the government to make an allocation to already privatised companies. Suswan who said his Committee would not tolerate the allocation accused those he called lieutenants of President Muhammadu Buhari of frustrating his genuine intention to revive the power sector.

Another member of the Committee, Senator Yusuf Yusuf who equally expressed dissatisfaction told Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Power, Louis Edozien, that budgetary provision for ‘Discos’ was a misplaced fund as he declared that attention should have been given to the almost moribund Mambila power project. Justifying the allocation to the ‘Disco’, Mr. Edozien said the N600 million was part of the agreement, the Power Ministry had with the ‘Disco’. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
