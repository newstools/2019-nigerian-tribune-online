Also, a 13-year-old boy alleged of rape was discovered among the inmates and the Chief Judge directed that he should be transferred to children correctional centre. At Olokuta facility, 16 inmates were released, while some were released on health grounds, others were released for lack of diligent prosecution on the part of the Department of Public Prosecution in the ministry of justice. The Chief Judge, however, warned the Department of Public Prosecution against shoddiness as she observed that some cases that ought to have been dispensed are not handled expeditiously as the ACJL stipulates. She advised the department to live up to their responsibilities and be mindful of the provisions of the ACJL so that they would not add to the congestion in correctional centres. She issued stern warning against tardiness on the part of some Magistrates especially in the Okitipupa judicial division as some cases were adjourned for a period of three months.
