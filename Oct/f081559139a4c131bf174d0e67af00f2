For Funmilola Oniyelu, life has been one long night of pain, distress and untold hardship. In the last few years, Funmilola has had to contend with kidney related issues which necessitated a renal transplant. The initial kidney transplant was carried out in April 2016 after which it failed recently in July 2019. According to her consultant nephrologist, Dr N.K. Anya of Zenith Medical and Kidney Centre, Abuja, in a letter made available to Nigerian Tribune, Funmilola “presented a failed allograft about 7 weeks ago and is currently on a dialysis for possible renal replacement. The best treatment option for chronic kidney disease in terms of improved quality of life and long term survival is a kidney transplant which involves surgically grafting a kidney from a suitable donor to the patient to restore normal kidney function. Buhari promises revival of Nigeria-Russia relations “The treatment plan stated above requires substantial funding and the details of the financial implications, which includes the cost of both donor and recipient evaluations and eventual surgery: kidney donor price: N2,000,000; transplant fee: N8, 300,000; cross matching: N590,000; accumulated treatment bill: N4,000,000; follow-up drug after treatment: N3,000,000.” This totals N17,990,000. Funmilola has been said to be vulnerable to series of infections in recent times. She still feels very uncomfortable and therefore has to be going through dialysis as often as possible to be able to pass out urine. A donor is said to have been linked and negotiation has been made with the donor. The hospital is ready to slate her for transplant the earliest if all it takes will be made available.
