Clement Illoh, former Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, on Thursday was sentenced to five years in prison by the Lagos State Special Offences Court, Ikeja, after he was found guilty on two counts of stealing by converting the sum of N14.1million, and property of the Nigerian Maritime and Safety Agency (NIMASA). The presiding judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo, however, acquitted him of the third count of concealment. While delivering judgement on the first two counts, Justice Taiwo also ordered the convict to make restitution of the total sum of money back to the government, and that the funds be paid to Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation.

EFCC alleged that the defendant supervised government programmes such as the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme, and used his position to award fictitious contracts to himself using personal company and friends. According to the prosecution, about N3.5m was recovered from the defendant during the investigation. The charge reads in part, “That you, Clement Illoh, a.k.a Clement & Bob Associate, on or about January 28, 2015 at Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court whilst still a Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, dishonestly converted to your own use the sum of N14,176,000.00 (Fourteen million, one hundred and seventy- six thousand naira) from the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and you hereby committed an offence contrary to Section 279(1)(b) & 285(6) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State No,11,2011.” How premature ejaculation  and small penis almost ruin my marriage and made my wife cheat on me, until my Abuja doctor recommend this powerful but simple solution that work wonder...DONT BE A VICTIM....
