Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) and partners have remitted about two billion U.S. Dollars (about N720 billion) to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in 16 years, an official said. SPDC’s General Manager, External Relations, Igo Weli, disclosed this on Tuesday at the final of 2019 SPDC-JV Environment Awareness Quiz Competition for Land Hub Community Secondary Schools in and around Port Harcourt. He said the money was released to NDDC as part of the company’s contribution towards the development of the Niger Delta. “SPDC, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) and her partners have put in two billion U.S. dollars to NDDC, which is quite huge. “The money was put into NDDC from 2002 to 2018,” he said. Weli said that besides the remittance to NDDC the company had made huge contributions on both human and infrastructure development in its host Niger Delta communities. The general manager, however, pointed out that SPDC was a business venture, and so, should not be mistaken by the people as a government body.

But the truth is that we cannot solve all the problems. “We are not saying that we are not going to make efforts to make improvement; we do already. “However, about 80 per cent of Nigeria’s budget is funded by the oil and gas industry and which Shell is right at the front in contributing to that. “People call us to say ‘my road is not good.’ But maybe their road is in the money SPDC and its Joint Venture partners paid to the government or to NDDC,” he said.
