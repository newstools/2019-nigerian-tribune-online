The Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) has berated those canvassing for the return of the pre-shipment inspection scheme at the nation’s seaports, describing them as agents of neo-colonialists. The national vice president of ANLCA, Dr Kayode Farinto, who made his position on the matter known in a press release recently said that those behind the clamour for the return of the pre-shipment inspection agents were doing so for pecuniary gains. 2023: I’m vindicated on South-West Presidency, says APC chieftain, Ahmed Lawal Northern states, businessmen not patronising Kaduna dry port… At MACN roundtable, FG seeks increased awareness on PSSP… Amaechi, others to grace CRFFN workshop Nigerian shippers to pay more as IMO sulphur regulation… “There are actually pitfalls here and there in the Destination Inspection exercise, but if the Federal Government can purchase new modern scanning machines, it will reduce the chances of importation of arms, ammunition and psychotropic drugs/substances. “The World Customs Organisation (WCO) Framework on Trade Facilitation never recommended pre-shipment inspectors as solution to challenges of non-conformist importations.
