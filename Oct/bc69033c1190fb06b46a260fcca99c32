The company declared a $29m interim dividend to shareholders and highlighted that its recent £382m cash acquisition of Eland Oil and Gas Plc would create more value opportunities for shareholders going forward. Working interest production averaged 47,163 boepd for the period and reflects slippage to the intended production drilling programme as a result of rig mobilisation delays and availability. Cash generated from operations stood at US$306 million versus capex incurred US$64 million. Full-year 2019 capex spend expected to be around US$120 million; gross debt of US$350 million at 30 September consists solely of the 2023 senior notes with undrawn headroom of US$225 million available through the 2022 RCF. Cash at bank as at 30 September was US$455 million resulting in a net cash position of US$105 million. Commenting on the result, the Chief executive Officer, SEPLAT, Mr Austin Avuru, said: “2019 so far has seen us make significant progress towards furthering our ambitious growth strategy. Our core business remains highly cash generative and with four rigs now operational in the field we expect to quickly regain momentum. This is reflected in our decision to declare an interim dividend of US$29 million.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
