President Muhammadu Buhari has in Sochi, Russia, assured that Nigerians will be protected anywhere they are in the world. Speaking at a gathering of students and professionals, on Thursday, at the conclusion of his three-day visit to Russia, he said: “The life of every Nigerian, in every part of the world matters.” The President promised to stretch the government’s reach and capacity in protecting all Nigerians, not minding the distance. “Our government will protect Nigerians at home, and abroad,’’ he said. President Buhari said the Nigeria Diaspora Commission, headed by Abike Dabiri-Erewa, was established to ensure a forward and backward link for all Nigerians living outside the country by catering for their safety and needs, and providing a platform for many who would like to contribute to the development of the country with their skills, knowledge and resources. “Don’t forget your home,’’ the President said, advising all Nigerians living in foreign countries to be law-abiding and work very hard to excel in their studies and chosen careers. The President assured that his administration will always be people-focused, pointing out that all the programmes of the administration had been tailored to buoy the economy and protect the poor and vulnerable. “We must create jobs to meet the growing demands in the country, and we are looking at agriculture already,’’ he added.

Incidentally, we have a lot in common. “Russia exports crude oil like Nigeria, and it is the second-largest producer of gas in the world. A lot can be learnt from their journey. We will collaborate in agriculture, oil and gas, and solid minerals exploration,’’ he said. The Nigerian Ambassador, Prof Steve Davies Ugbah, said the President had restored the pride of all Nigerians by consistently meeting with citizens in countries he visited. In his remarks, the President of Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation (NIDO) in Russia, Chukwujeku Ejike Sam-Fester, said President Buhari demonstrated a high sense of maturity and patriotism by visiting South Africa on October 3rd, 2019, to discuss issues relating to attacks on foreigners, including Nigerians, in the country. “We are proud of you for taking that step to reconcile not only Nigeria and South Africa, but the entire continent,’’ he said. Sam-Fester urged the government to extend gestures like the National Identity Card, BVN, 10-year validity passport and encourage more participation in governance by inviting professionals in foreign countries to provide services. In her remarks, a Nigeria female student in Russia, Kadija Mohammed Babanzara, commended the President for consistency in the payment of bursaries to students. “Since you came into power, our bursaries are paid in full and timely. We are grateful,’’ she said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE
