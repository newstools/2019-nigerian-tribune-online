My letter of June 17, 2019 on this page with headline: Erect bumps on Ijokodo-Polytechnic-Apete road’ refers I, on behalf of the good people of Ijokodo, The Polytechnic, Ibadan and Apete communities, wish to register our profound gratitude to the governor of Oyo state, Engr. Seyi Makinde, for his quick intervention in our communities’ request for the construction of bumps on the above mentioned road, which had earlier turned a death trap to motorists/road users along the axis. The bumps were noticed on Friday, October 25, 2019 to the admiration of all and sundry. William Shakespeare says in his book, Macbeth that “to be thus is nothing, but be safely thus.” PDP, Atiku plotting to malign Supreme Court Justices, APC alleges Anybody passing through the road since weekend would notice that the bumps were not only timely fixed but they were properly constructed. This shows that the governor appears not to move around or stay in his office with his eyes closed and ears blocked to people’s clarion calls to issues as they affect the citizenry.

Menace of sexual harassment: Beyond wails and penalties Some would say it is too early to access governor but I say that the foundation determines the righteousness. Hence, I implore governors across the length and breadth of Nigeria to follow the steps being taken by the Oyo State governor. I also use this medium to thank the Nigerian Tribune authorities for the opportunity of getting across to the governor on behalf of the aforementioned communities and also to congratulate the oldest privately owned newspaper in Nigeria on its 70th anniversary billed for November 16, 2019.
