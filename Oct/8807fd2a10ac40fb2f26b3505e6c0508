Chukwuanugo, who is facing a murder charge, said this while been cross-examined by the Lagos State Prosecutor, Mr Tunde Sunmonu. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the defendant has been in custody since his first arraignment on Jan. 20, 2016. The defendant, who opened his defence on March 5, told the court that he was in love with the woman and had no intention of killing her. He said that he fled the crime scene on noticing that the late girlfriend, Lizzy Nzewi, was foaming from the mouth, adding that the woman’s death was not intentional. Chukwuanugo said the two were having a fight over a misunderstanding when the woman slumped. The defendant told the court he also sustained an injury in his scrum while struggling with the deceased.

Earlier, the defence counsel, Mr J.C. Jiakponna had told the court that the hospital where the defendant was treated from his injuries, was not cooperating with the defence team, adding that the hospital’s evidence would help the case of his client.
