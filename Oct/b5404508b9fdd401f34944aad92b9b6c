Babatunde Salam, Senator Ubok Anang had during the tension soaked engagement frowned at the refusal of the Commission to submit its internally generated revenue to the National Assembly for appropriation. The lawmakers also took the PENCOM Director General to task over her submission that the Secretary to the Government of the Federation approves the proposal on the utilisation of the Internally Generated Revenue accrued to the agency, contrary to section 21 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007 and Section 80(4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).
