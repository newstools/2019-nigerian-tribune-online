Nigerians have condemned the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) following the recent raid of its officers on a hotel, Fraser suites, in Abuja. The Customs officers had on Wednesday, invaded Fraser Suites in Abuja and prevented foreign diplomats and guests who had lodged in the hotel from going out, and other customers were also not allowed into the hotel. The officers, according to sources had trained some suspects into the hotel. However, while some Nigerians reacting on Twitter, condemned the action of the Customs officials, some were in support of it, while others were indifferent about it. A Twitter user with the username Mazi (@matthewamad), had reported the incident on his page, and it triggered other reactions. According to Mazi, he said: “Happening Now: Customs Officers just invaded Fraser Suites in Abuja, preventing foreign diplomats and guests lodged in the hotel from coming in or going out. They are harassing and ordering the staff to wake guests up from sleep to identify their cars & show Customs duty. This is bad! https://twitter.com/matthewamad/status/1179547077803675648 “Keep driving away investors. “By the time Buhari is done, Somalia’s economy will be better than Nigeria’s.
