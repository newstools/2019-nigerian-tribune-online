Regardless of who you are or what you wear, time and gravity will cause your skin to become weaker and less elastic. However, young women might experience sagging breasts as well.

These include; multiple pregnancies, smoking, large, heavy breasts; extreme weight loss; being overweight; overexposure to the sun’s UV; some extreme, high-intensity strenuous exercise as well as certain illnesses, such as breast cancer and tuberculosis.
