Prof. Babagana Zulum has approved the release of twenty-six million naira as grants to twenty-six students undergoing degree programs at the Islamic University of Madinah in Saudi Arabia. The Governor’s approval of this education grant is meant to subsidise the expenses of the students who are not under the scholarship of the Borno government. The Governor announced the grant after the students met him in Madinah on Tuesday, while he was on a two-day visit to Makkah on transit from Madina to perform the lesser hajj, Umrah.

The support he noted was for students of different levels, including those in the final year, who would require financing some aspects of their dissertations to fulfil the requirements for graduation. The Governor also gave assurance of automatic employment to those who will excel, noting that with the government’s ongoing plans to increase the number of higher (integrated) Islamic schools, opportunities will be there for the majority of the students. The higher Islamic school, long-established in Borno State, provides opportunities for Islamic scholars who meet certain standards and pass foundation courses, to enrol for western education at post-secondary levels. Responding on behalf of the students, Manzo Mohammed, assured the Governor of their readiness to make the Governor proud. Their meeting, he said, was first of its kind.
