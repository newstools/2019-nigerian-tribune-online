Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has assured the people of the Ondo North Senatorial district that roads within the four local government areas connecting the state with other neighbouring towns and states would be constructed to give room to connectivity and mobility within and outside the state. Gbajabiamila who made this pledge during a civic reception held in honour of the lawmaker representing Akoko North East/North West Federal Constituency, Hon. Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, in Oke Agbe, Ondo state, lamented the deplorable state of roads in the entire Akoko area. He blamed the terrible condition of the road on the neglect by past governments and representatives from the area, accusing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of neglecting the people of the area for 16 years. He, however, expressed optimism that the representatives from the area would considerably address the bad and collapsing roads in the Akoko land.

He said: “I believed that at the end of the four years tenure, the people of Akoko will not regret electing Hon. Bunmi Tunji-Ojo to represent them at the National Assembly. “This makes it my fifth tenure at the National Assembly, despite this, I have never seen any member of the House constructing a 10km road, not even me.” He further said that Ondo state is the only state at the National Assembly, that every one of its members respective of party affiliation is appointed into the committee leadership, either as chairman of committees or deputy chairman. He called for continued support for Tunji- Ojo and the All Progressives Congress (APC) assuring that the party would bring the expected change for the people of the state.
