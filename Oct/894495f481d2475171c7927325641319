His resignation letter dated October 2, was addressed to the national chairman of the party in Abuja. According to the letter, Faforiji, who is a close associate of former deputy governor of Osun State, and the party’s governorship candidate in the last election, Senator Iyiola Omisore, said his voluntary resignation was as a result of his ideological perspective and value which he said were at variance with that of the party. The letter read thus, “I have come to realisee the requirement of my office as state chairman and member of the party in the current circumstances, are at variance with the value that I believe in, and wish to protect for as long as God gives me sustenance.” Faforiji, however, thanked and appreciated all the national working committee and members of the party in Osun for their support and love they showed him when he was in office, most especially during the campaign and Osun State gubernatorial election in 2018.
