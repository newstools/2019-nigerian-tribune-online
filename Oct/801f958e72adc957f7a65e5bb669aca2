The Multichoice CEO said that many hard works had gone into making the most popular reality show in Nigeria a reality. “A lot has gone into the BBNaija show. We had a dream to have a house in Nigeria after a multi-purpose one built outside the country. “I think it’s such a miracle to have another one ready in Nigeria within the six months of conception. It appears impossible to us, but just like Nigeria’s spirit, we can do anything. “We threw everything at the BBNaija house and it was completed. The parent company, Endemol needs to inspect and certify it before commission so they came to Nigeria and inspect,” he said.

We have the record of over 50 million votes in the final week of the season,” he said.

This is hard to come by. “I have not had a better Independence Day celebration than what I had during the show, and we have also seen men engaging in cooking and so many positives,” he said. NAN reports that the top five housemates of the reality show were also in attendance with sponsors such as Bet9ja, Heritage Bank, Innoson Motors and others. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
