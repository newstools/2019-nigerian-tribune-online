The FIR stated that Tawakalitu asked the defendant to take her home, but he took her to a hotel on the pretext that he wanted to collect something there. The FIR revealed that Oriyomi, again, in a bid to perpetrate his nefarious act, wasted the victim’s time by taking her to a filling station to buy fuel and later to an uncompleted building in the bush. While driving towards the uncompleted facility, the police report disclosed that Tawakalitu tried to escape by jumping out of the bike, a development that made her sustain injuries on her left hand.
