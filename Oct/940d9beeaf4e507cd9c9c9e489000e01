Justice Bayo Taiwo of the Oyo State High Court, on Wednesday, sentenced one Shola John Wright to one year imprisonment for defrauding an American citizen, Erica Hegge, of the sum of $1,450. Wright, a 29-year-old, who operated with the pseudonym David Riger, was found guilty of a one-count charge of obtaining money by false pretence filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibadan zonal office. The offence, according to the EFCC Spokesperson, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, “runs contrary to Section 419 of the Criminal Code, Cap 38, Laws of Oyo State, 2000. He pleaded guilty to the charge when read to him.” Uwujaren noted that the “plea was consequent upon a plea bargain agreement between Wright and the Commission.” ALSO READ: Court remands man over alleged murder in Ekiti Police foil attack on two suspected gays in Ogun Court remands seven in prison for allegedly vandalising… Man, bags 7 years imprisonment for causing grievous hurt Court remands man over alleged murder in Ekiti While relating with his victim, Wright, It was informed he had “falsely presented himself as a white man to gain access and subsequently preyed on her.
