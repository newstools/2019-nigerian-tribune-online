All Israeli embassies and consulates around the world were shut down on Wednesday because of a strike by the country’s diplomats and military attaches, the foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that all Israeli missions would remain closed until further notice. The closure is taking place amidst a dispute between Israel’s foreign ministry and the finance ministry over the expense stipends of the workers. The finance ministry said it would oblige the envoys to return money they had already been reimbursed for expenses.
