Two hundred million naira (N200,000,000) has been proposed by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources for tracking water supply under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) programme in the 2020 Appropriation Bill, Nigerian Tribune investigation has revealed. The item listed as part of the Economic Recovery Growth Programme (ERGP) had the sum of N14,723,993 budget in the currently running 2019 budget, showing an increase of over N170 million, an amount more than 120 per cent increase over the 2019 allocation for the same budgetary item. It reads: “ERGP 18110701 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) tracking for water supply ongoing to cost N200,000,000 in the 2020 Appropriation Bill before the National Assembly for defence and ERGP 18110701 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) tracking for water supply ongoing in the 2019 Appropriation Act at the sum of N14,723,993.” President Muhammadu Buhari had, while presenting the budget to the joint session of the National Assembly a few weeks ago, tagged the 2020 Appropriation Bill as Budget of Sustaining Growth and Job Creation. Nigerian Tribune learnt that the excess amount of over N170 million could fix some ongoing earth dam projects in the budget, like the construction of Jada multipurpose dam at N24,380,040; Inyishi regional water supply project at N50,000,000; construction of Kagara earth dam at N25,681,804; rehabilitation of Ekuku dam at N15,000,000; construction of small earth dam in Odugbo at N15,706,603 and rehabilitation and reticulation of Fugar waterworks, Etsako Central Local Government of Edo State at N35,000,090. Nigerian Tribune investigation also revealed that the Ministry of Water Resources will be spending another N20 million to produce a compendium and digital map of dams in Nigeria in 2020 if approved by the National Assembly after it had N13.462,802 budgeted for it in its 2019 Appropriation Act which is still being implemented. The incremental difference of N6.5 million in the 2020 budget, Nigerian Tribune gathered, could complete about three projects in different parts of the country as captured in the Appropriation Bill 2020. These are ERGP28110998 construction of drainage and land reclamation in Peremabiri ongoing at the cost of N1,880,703; a new project ERGP28111021 Dadin-Kowa irrigation project at the total sum of N2,703,972 and  ERGP28111065 rehabilitation of Ibu irrigation project ongoing N2,331,450.
