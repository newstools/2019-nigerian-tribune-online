THE National Council of Muslim Youth Organisations (NACOMYO) has urged Nigerians to keep hope alive as the country moves into its 60th year of independence. The council made the appeal in a statement in Abuja signed by its national president and national secretary general, Malam Suleiman Maigoro and Alhaji Mas’ud Akintola. “Our myriads of problems like insecurity, economic instability and corruption are surmountable and would be overcome if we are really determined and we cooperate with our leaders,” NACOMYO said. It implored the citizenry not to curse the leaders “as they are not the cause of the nation’s woes but we all need to embark on sincere repentance and change from our iniquitous ways of life.” The apex Muslim body implored public officeholders not to renege on their electoral promises as doing so was tantamount to betrayal of trust.
