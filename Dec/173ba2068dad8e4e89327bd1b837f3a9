The Body of Retired Head of Local Government Administration (BORHOLGAS) in Ogun, has sent a Save Our Soul to the State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, over eight years of unpaid gratuities. BORHOLGAS in a statement signed by its Social/Publicity Secretary, Mr Kayode Ekundayo, said local government retirees were last paid their entitlements in August 2011. The body, said most its members, are ageing, ailing and dying, as they could not afford good living, due to lack of fund. “While we are not unmindful of the general economic situation, the body passionately appealed to the Governor to see to the consolidation of the monthly pension and the payment of gratuity to the local government pensioners which has been in arrears for eight years,” BORHOLGAS added.
