The Lagos State Government has announced plans to close the Mile 2 to Tin-Can Island express road section of the Apapa-Oshodi expressway to traffic for 72 hours effective from Monday, December 9, 2019. According to a statement issued by the State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Fredric Oladeinde at the weekend, the planned closure is to allow the Lagos State Government to carry out palliative works on the bad portion on the axis without any vehicular hindrance. According to the Commissioner “Effective from Midnight of Sunday, December 8, 2019, all vehicles and trucks carrying export products and empty containers for Tin-Can Port operations are to stay out of the corridor for the next three days so as to carry out the palliative work on the road”.

Consequently, the Commissioner urged freight forwarders, fleet operators, transport agents and trucks owners to take note of the traffic arrangement and comply accordingly, adding that any inconvenience arising from the closure is regrettable as the effort is aimed at improving vehicular movement in the region.
