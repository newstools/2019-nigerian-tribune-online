Jaiz Charity and Development Foundation and its partners, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the American University of Nigeria (AUN), have put smiles on the faces of 120 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Damasak, Borno State, with training and empowerment tools. The foundation provided the tools worth over N7 million as a way of complementing government efforts. The Executive Director of the foundation, Dr Abdullahi Shuaib, said the organisation sponsored the intervention for sustainability through the UNHCR, while AUN provided the resource persons that trained the beneficiaries for two months.

They were trained in packaged beverage business, groundnut and palm oil extraction business, cooking and consumable business, locally produced spaghetti business, baked beans business, among other vocations. “All the beneficiaries were equally provided with start-up capitals in order to assist them to start well and grow their businesses,” Shuaib said. He said the conditions of the IDPs and their inability to access the larger market for economic activities motivated the foundation to partner with UNHCR to build their capacity and that of the host community with a view to improving their livelihoods.
