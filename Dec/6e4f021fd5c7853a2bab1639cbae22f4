THE Nigeria Customs Service has alerted its zonal, regional and other offices across the nation of an outbreak of Charcoal Anthrax Disease Bacterium Bacillus Anthraces in Niger Republic. Meat from animals infected with the bacteria can kill. Customs said the alert became necessary to ensure the disease does not spread into the Nigerian territory following the inflow of sheep and cattle from Niger to Nigeria. In a memo from the Comptroller, Enforcement of the Nigeria Customs, Victor Dimka, to all zonal coordinators, all Customs area comptrollers and other relevant offices, it noted that the disease could be transmitted to man directly or indirectly through contact with infected animal or inhalation. The memo reads: “Headquarters is in receipt of report which reveals that the Nigerien Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock had notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) of an outbreak of Charcoal Anthrax Disease Bacterium Bacillus Anthracis in sheep and cattle in the country.

The disease was first reported in Niger’s Tillaberry Region on 23rd November, 2019 where it killed three cattle. “Since then, over 100 cattle have been infected and 22 recorded death. Transmission to human occurs directly or indirectly from infected animals or due to occupational exposure to contaminated animal products. “The disease manifests either as a scratch that could progress into a sepsis or as pulmonary infection due to inhalation of micro organisms suspended in the air without immediate treatment. Charcoal Anthrax is fatal in 20 per cent of cases. “Given the supply of cattle and sheep from Niger to Nigeria, the CGC has directed on the urgent need to place additional precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the disease into Nigeria through our land borders.” “This is for your information and urgent necessary action, please”.
