The Anambra State Police Command on Wednesday, paraded the General Overseer of Mount Zion Ministries, Obosi, in Idemili North Local Government Area, Evangelist Chukwudi Chukwumezie, 34, for raping a 15-year-old girl. The pastor, who was confirmed by witnesses to have been involved in previous cases of rape, involving minors, was said to have lured the victim to his church, with the prophecy that she had a bright future but was hindered by evil spirits. The State Police Public Relations Officer PPRO, SP Haruna Mohammed, who paraded the suspect, told newsmen that the police obtained a medical report, showing that the victim (name withheld) had a penetration, and the hymen lacerated. According to him, “On 24th September 2019, we got a report from a woman in Obosi police station that the pastor of Mountain Zion Ministry, Obosi had unlawful canal knowledge of her daughter. “Police officers went to the scene, inspected it and the victim was rushed to the hospital and medical report revealed that her vagina was penetrated and laceration of the hymen of the victim occurred.

She said she had visited the pastor with her daughter when he told her she needed to undergo deliverance. “I sent my daughter there, especially as the pastor had said that my daughter had a bright future, but had something covering her. He even said he was ready to train her for us.” The suspect, however, denied the allegations, saying she only prayed for the girl, and since she was the last person to leave the church, he decided to drop her at her house but sped past her house. “When I asked her, she said I had passed her house, so I stopped at Nkwo ATM point since I had to withdraw money to pay transportation for our members who were going to the mountain.” He denied having canal knowledge of the minor, insisting that the girl was being used to set him up by another pastor, who was operating at Obosi.
