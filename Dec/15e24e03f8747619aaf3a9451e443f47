We don’t want children who should be in schools on the streets because their mothers cannot afford school fees. Who knows if the future president is among them? Every child should have access to education and good life and that is what CBA Foundation intends to achieve. “To change our society and make the world a better place, we must love, give and share no matter how small. Hence, the net proceeds of this year’s walk will go to back to school support project for pupils in our adopted schools and for empowering selected underprivileged widows to start a business.” “Therefore, every step counts! Every step you take brings us closer to offering hope to underprivileged widows and their children,” Bode-Akinwande concluded.
