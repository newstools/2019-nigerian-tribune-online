Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State, on Thursday, inaugurated 14-member committee for monitoring process of Administration of Criminal Justice as part of measures to ensure speedy justice delivery in the state. Inaugurating the committee, Masari noted that the objective of every legal system is to deliver justice, which is the pillar that upholds decency in civilised human societies. He reminded members of the committee that justice is the best guarantee for peace, prosperity and good governance. “There is the urgent need to address the speed of justice delivery by all stakeholders in the justice sector,” he said. He lamented that the justice delivery system is bedevilled by the problem of delays and inefficiency. “It was in response to the challenges that the reforms in the justice sector became imperative, hence the signing into law in May 2019, the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Katsina State,” he said. According to Masari, the broad objective of the law is to facilitate an efficient and transparent criminal justice delivery which he said would, in turn, induce confidence in the court system. He said the law had specified the functions of the committee in fast-tracking the process of crime investigation, prosecution and conviction. Masari added that the law had made adequate provisions on the role of all stakeholders in coordinating, monitoring and assuring timelines of the process from arrest until the conclusion of the trial.
