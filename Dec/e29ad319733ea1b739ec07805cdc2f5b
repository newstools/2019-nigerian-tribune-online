THE National President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Dr. Felix Omobude has faulted the marriage certificate law which was recently introduced by the Federal Government. In a statement in Benin City on Sunday, Omobude, the general overseer of the New Covenant Gospel Church chided the Ministry of Interior for imposing the law, which he insisted was anti-Christian and the church in Nigeria. The Ministry of Interior had recently announced a compulsory N30,000 charge licence for Christian worship centres for the conduct of statutory marriages in churches and N21,000 for each marriage certificate. The PFN leader described the policy as exploitative and an attempt to commercialise Christian marriages in the country.

Omobude vowed that the PFN would use all legitimate means at its disposal to make the Federal Government rescind the controversial marriage certificate law. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
