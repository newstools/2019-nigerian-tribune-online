After you’re diagnosed with epilepsy, you have several ways to get treatment. Medication, a special diet, an implant that works on your nerves or brain, and surgery could all help you feel better. Many doctors usually try medications first. The goal of treatment in patients with epileptic seizures is to achieve a seizure-free status without adverse effects. This goal is accomplished in more than 60% of patients who require treatment with anticonvulsants. Many patients experience adverse effects from these drugs, however, and some patients have seizures that are refractory to medical therapy. This is why you need to see a specialist physician who will review your case and place you on an appropriate treatment. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
