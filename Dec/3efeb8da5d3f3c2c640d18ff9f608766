The National Directorate of Employment (NDE), in Kaduna, on Monday dragged a businesswoman, Tina Simon to Sharia Court, Magajin Gari, Kaduna, seeking to recover N130,000 loan owed 10 years ago. The directorate, through its counsel, Hannatu Bello-Maude, told the court that Simon was granted the sum of N163,000 as a loan after she received training in 2009. The council told the court that Simon was to pay back the loan in instalments within two years but defaulted and had paid N33,000 only. Bello-Maude, therefore, prayed the court to compel the defendant to settle N130,000 being the balance of the amount granted her 10 years ago.
