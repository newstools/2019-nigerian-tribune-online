Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, on Tuesday, inaugurated newly elected chairmen and vice chairmen for the 16 local government councils in the state, with a charge that they must make themselves accessible to the people. It will be recalled the new council helmsmen were elected during the December 7, local government election in the state and sworn in on Tuesday, a week after the expiration of the tenure of their predecessors, who were elected on the platform of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP). Fayemi who told the new council bosses to prioritise the welfare of Ekiti people above their personal interest, stated that as the people’s representatives in government, the local government chairmen must make “far-reaching impact on the lives of a lot of people.” The governor urged them to key into the 5 pillar agenda of his administration which is aimed at eradicating poverty from the State and deliver the dividends of democracy to the grassroots. He advised them to familiarize themselves with the Local Government Administration Laws and Local Government Service Commission Laws of Ekiti State in order to guide them on the operational activities of the council.

You are now their representatives in the government and equally the ambassadors of the government in your respective constituencies and Local Government Areas. You are therefore enjoined to relate with your people and make yourselves accessible even more than before, ” he said. On his decision to allow the outgone council bosses elected during the Fayose-led government to complete their tenure, the governor said his administration is “resolutely committed to upholding and respecting rule of law at all times” hence the decision not to scuttle local government administration or interfere with their funds. “The inauguration of these chairmen and vice-chairmen, today, follows the tenure expiration of the council elected officials we inherited from the last administration. Despite the barrage of allegations and actions against some of the local government elected officials after their probe by the Ekiti State House of Assembly, as a government, we adhered strictly to the sanctity of their tenure. “They were allowed to run their full course before the election that produced the new set of chairmen, vice-chairmen and councillors for the sixteen local government areas of Ekiti State”, Fayemi said. Fayemi who charged the two new commissioners on creativity and innovation expressed optimism that the duo would make a huge impact in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Arts, Culture and Tourism which they are to man. The two new Commissioners are Mr Ayoola Owolabi (Finance) and Professor Razaq Ojo Bakare (Arts, Culture and Tourism). While responding on behalf of the newly sworn-in chairmen, the chairman of Ado Local Government, Hon (Mrs) Motunde Fajuyi, promised that the council bosses would key into the rural development programme of the government and make a positive impact on the lives of the people.
