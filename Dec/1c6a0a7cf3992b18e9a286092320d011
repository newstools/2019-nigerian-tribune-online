The NG foundation is Calling all music artists to join hands in lifting education in Africa and developing communities around the world. Music for Relief, a program of the NG FOUNDATION INC. is dedicated to providing aid for underprivileged kids to help them reach their greatest potential. Each ambassadorship comes with $5,000 check if won and the opportunity to work with the foundation and performing in each of our events globally.
