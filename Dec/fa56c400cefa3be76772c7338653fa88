A Sudanese court sentenced 27 members of the national intelligence service to death by hanging on Monday over the killing of a teacher in detention in February during protests that led to the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir. It was the first time courts have handed down convictions over crackdowns on demonstrations in the months before and after Bashir was toppled in April. Thirteen defendants were sentenced to prison terms and a further four were acquitted in the verdict, which could face several stages of appeal.
