Kazakhstan observed a day of mourning on Saturday after a plane crashed just after take-off on Friday and killed 12 people, including the pilot. The government in the Central Asian country called on the media to refrain from broadcasting all forms of entertainment on Saturday, according to Kazakh media. The Fokker 100 aircraft, operated by Kazakh airline Bek Air, broke through a concrete wall before hitting a two-storey residential building in Almaty. Authorities have grounded other Fokker 100 planes in the country. Investigators are focusing on whether the accident was caused by pilot error or a technical fault.
