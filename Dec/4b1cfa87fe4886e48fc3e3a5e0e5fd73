President Muhammadu Buhari has recognized Col. David Imuse (rtd), the Edo State All Progressive Congress (APC) chairman loyal to the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Imuse is among the 35 APC state chapter chairmen summoned for a meeting with the president at the presidential villa, Abuja on Friday. Whereas Anslem Ojezua, the party chairman loyal to Godwin Obaseki, came to the villa for the meeting, he was not given security clearance and therefore, turned back from the gate.
