ONE of the major problems in Nigeria is human trafficking. A lot of people fall victim of it. Traffickers may use force, deception, etc. It is estimated that over 60 per cent of sex workers in Italy are from Nigeria. The causes of human trafficking in Nigeria are poverty, lack of education, immigration policy, environmental conditions, and lack of good job opportunities. There is no doubt that these conditions create a toxic cocktail of vulnerability. Complete disregard for human rights is also a cause for human trafficking. Women and children are often viewed as objects that can be sold. Thus, they are sold into slavery and sexual exploitation. People are often dissatisfied with what they have even if they have perfectly decent living conditions; they try to go out in search of a better life.
