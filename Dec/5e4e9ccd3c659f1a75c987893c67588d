The Ministry of Finance on Monday launched the Federal Government’s Financial Transparency Policy, Open Treasury Portal at the ICC in Abuja. The portal launch, according to the Minister of Finance, Budget & National Planning, Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, was another step by the Federal Government to entrench transparency and accountability in public finances. According to Zainab, the portal will aid the government in its fight against corruption through the availability of financial information to the general public, MDAs and civil society organisations. Zainab added that full implementation of the programme by all the MDAs is expected latest by the end of three months.

Minister of State for Niger Delta, Senator Tayo Alasoadura who represented President Muhammadu Buhari, at the event, highlighted that the Transparency Policy approved by the Federal Executive Council requires that the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) must publish a Daily Treasury Statement. The statement will provide information about what came into the national purse and what went out every single day. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
