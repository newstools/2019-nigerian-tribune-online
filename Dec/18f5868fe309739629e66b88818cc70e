It is no longer news that Governor Abdulahi Umaru Ganduje of Kano State and the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi have been at loggerheads over the creation of additional emirates. The question to be asked is, what does governor Ganduje want to do with newly created additional emirates? Will they bring any development to Kano State? For me, the governor’s intention is just to express his anger against Emir Sanusi. It has been reported that the unending feud between Ganduje and Sanusi began shortly before this year’s general election and there were strong indications that Ganduje wanted to dethrone Sanusi over allegations that the Emir worked against his re-election bid. Any monarch in Nigeria can work against any government; they have a right like others to choose who represents them, so the governor shouldn’t allow anyone to mislead him to attempt to dethrone Sanusi. If Allah says yes, nobody can say no. The people of Kano have voted you into power for second term and Emir Sanusi can’t change your destiny to rule Kano state for the second term.

The rift between Sanusi and Ganduje should not be taken with levity by northern elders, eminent citizens of Kano both home and abroad should not keep silent and watch history repeat itself.
