Authorities of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) has nabbed a patient who allegedly made away with the mobile telephone of a doctor at the hospital. The suspect was arrested with the aid of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) at the weekend, Chief Medical Director, Prof. Darlington Obaseki, has said. Obaseki who spoke with journalists during an end of the year party organised by the staff explained that the female patient was admitted into the ward and while there, she stealthily went to where the doctor kept his phone and made away with it. The CMD said no sooner after the patient left that the doctor came looking for his phone but could not find it.

Obaseki said that careful observation of the CCTV revealed that the patient who was admitted into the ward had a hand in the deed. He said that the patient who was slated for days for continued treatment had not been discharged when the incident happened and that when the patient eventually showed up for treatment, she was confronted with the allegation and she reportedly owned up and the phone was retrieved from her. While commending the staff for their dedication to duty, he said that 80 per cent of them are fantastic and that such commitment to one’s duty cannot be found elsewhere. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
