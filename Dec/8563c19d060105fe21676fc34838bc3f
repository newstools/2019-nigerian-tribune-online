As these clumps grow and change, vision will become blurry; you may get double vision in one eye; your vision may turn yellow or become darker; or you may experience haziness like you are in fog. These protein clumps prevent light from passing through the eye as normal, so the images transmitted to the brain from the retina and optic nerve will be incomplete. Cataracts will eventually lead to blindness. When you develop them in one eye, you will likely develop them in the other eye. Although cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure that restores most visual acuity, many people want to avoid surgical procedures if they can. Even though some simple steps including diet, exercise and regular blood tests have been suggested to allow cataract sufferers to continue to live an independent and active life without surgery, none of these methods are as effective as surgery.
