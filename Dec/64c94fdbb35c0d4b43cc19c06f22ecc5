The Ondo State Unity Forum, an amalgam of all the various aggrieved interest groups in Ondo All Progressive Congress under the Chairmanship of a former deputy governor of the state, Alhaji Ali Olanusi, has lauded the National Chairman of the party and the National Working Committee for constituting the Ahmed Lawan-led Reconciliation Committee to look into the grievances of party members across the nation. The group which prides itself on having over 80 per cent of the genuine members of the APC in the state has lauded the Oshiomhole and the NWC for constituting the committee to look into the grievances of party members. The group in a letter signed by Alhaji Olanusi at the weekend stated that, “for us in Ondo State, the composition of the committee cannot come at a better time than now when we are approaching the 2020 gubernatorial election in the state.
