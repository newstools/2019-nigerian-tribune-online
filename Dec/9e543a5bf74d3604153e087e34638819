Senior Pastor and founder of the House on the Rock Church, Pastor Paul Adefarasin, two Saturdays ago hosted Lagos residents with a giveback initiative tagged: “The Project Spread Initiative.” The programme was part of the efforts of the church to extend a hand of fellowship to the underprivileged and the needy, sharing the love of Christmas and spreading the joy of Jesus Christ. The annual programme, which was held at five locations including Lagos Island, Elegusi, Ikeja, Gbagada, and Surulere, catered for over 30, 000 people including the aged, children, pregnant women, among others, as they were provided with various food items. Speaking on behalf of convener, Director of Missions, Pastor Adegoke Coker, said that the motive behind the initiative was to demonstrate the core responsibility of gospel, especially at the season of love.
