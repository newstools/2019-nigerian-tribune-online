The Lagos State Government last week presented a seed fund of N250 million to the Lagos State Science Research and Innovation Council (LASRIC) to boost technological innovation in the state. Presenting the cheque to members of the council at the State House, Ikeja, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said that it was part of plans to make Lagos State a hub for innovation and technology. LASRIC is a Lagos State institution in charge of research with the responsibility of boosting innovation and technology in the state. The council is presently made up of a 16-member team, headed by the Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Professor Toyin Ogundipe. Sanwo-Olu said that the fund would enable technology start-ups to come up with local innovative technologies that would enhance the economy. He urged the council to ensure that the criteria to access the fund was flexible enough for Lagosians to benefit from. “For us, it is to put action in what we believe in. When you make pronouncements as a government, you must put them to action. “I don’t want very stringent conditions that will not make people benefit from this fund. In the next six months, let us begin to see a litmus test that people have been supported through this fund.

We can think global but we have to act local. Let us think about solutions that are peculiar to us as Lagosians and Nigerians and you will be amazed that we have great skills waiting for people to bring them out,” the governor said.
