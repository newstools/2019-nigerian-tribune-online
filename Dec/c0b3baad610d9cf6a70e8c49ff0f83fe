Auditor General of the Federation, Anthony Ayine has frowned at the unwholesome preparation of Federal Government accounts leading to the under-reporting of N400 billion overdrafts by the Federal Government. Ayine disclosed this and other infractions in his 2017 Audit Report submitted to the National Assembly just recently.

The report described the inclusion of the TSA Settlement Centre balance as part of Investment Income in 2017 is inappropriate because this may indicate a material misstatement of balances in the Statement of Financial Performance. The Accountant General was also unable to explain inadequate disclosure of Aids and Grants amounting to N6.6 billion. A total of N9.03 billion was received as aids and grants, and a sum of N6,649,091,891.14 representing 74 per cent of the reported amount was said to be domestic grants during the 2017 fiscal year. “There was no information about the donors or the recipient MDAs to verify the occurrence, accuracy or completeness of the transaction”, the report stated. Ayine said although the Accountant-General was requested to provide the list of donors and benefiting MDAs, “no response was received as at the time of this report.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
