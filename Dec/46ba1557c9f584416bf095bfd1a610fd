Programmes Manager, Amnesty International Nigeria, Seun Bakare, said in a statement made available to Saturday Tribune that ”the attempted abduction and eventual rearrest of prisoners of conscience Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare, including the desecration of the Nigerian judiciary by officials of the State Security Service, tells a bigger story of impunity and flagrant disregard for the rule of law by the Nigerian government.
