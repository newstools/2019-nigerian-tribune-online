A former councillor in the Ekiti Local Government Area of Kwara State, Samuel Opeyemi Adeojo, has been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for being the leader of a car theft syndicate notorious for stealing vehicles from car dealers through pretence as genuine buyers. Until his arrest recently, the EFCC had been on his trail after series of petitions against his gang’s criminal activities were considered by the Commission’s Ibadan zonal office. According to a statement issued by the spokesperson of the Commission, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, no fewer than “three cases of car theft have been established against the syndicate, with all the vehicles involved recovered and kept in the Commission’s custody in Ibadan.” Uwujaren stated that “Investigations revealed that the gang deploys similar pattern of tricks to steal vehicles from their victims. “According to EFCC’s findings, Adeojo often pretend to be a medical doctor, adopting different names and different institutions as his place of work to appear responsible and create a false sense of confidence to penetrate the victims. “One of the many cases reported involved a Toyota Avensis wagon car in which Adeojo claimed to be one Dr Gboyega Omojola of the University College Hospital, Ibadan. “The case was reported to the EFCC, Ibadan office on March 23, 2019, by Tunde Adejuwon, an Ibadan-based car dealer.” Uwujaren added that “the petitioner, ‘Dr. Omojola’ had come in the company of one Babatunde Oluwatope Oni, his supposed driver, to his stand to negotiate for the car and later agreed to pay N2million for it. “After the agreement, ‘Dr. Omojola’ issued a N2m Skye Bank Cheque ostensibly in favour of the dealer and ordered his ‘driver’ to pay it into his Zenith Bank account at Bodija, Ibadan. “Oni later came with a copy of the Zenith bank deposit teller, depicting ‘payment’ of the agreed sum into the dealer’s account. “It was, however, later discovered that the payment was not approved as the payer used a cloned cheque for the transaction.

He left with the SUV with the promises to go and bring another cheque to offset the car cost. Oni was left behind. “Though he (Oni) had pretended to be sick all the while, he took advantage of the time the dealer went to return a borrowed battery to his colleague to strike. “Before the dealer’s return, Oni made away with the negotiated Avensis car. “The two were also linked with another car theft matter involving a Toyota Matrix car somewhere in Iwo, Osun State. “Oni is currently in the Agodi facility of the Nigeria Correctional Services following a court order when he was recently arraigned on one of the incidents.” The commission informed that Adeojo will have his day in court soon. The Commission is holding them for conspiracy, issuance of dud cheque and stealing. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
