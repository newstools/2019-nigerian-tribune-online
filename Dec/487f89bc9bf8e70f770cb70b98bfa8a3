The immediate past governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, has enjoined Nigerians celebrating Christmas to remember the needy in the society during their merriment this festive season. This, according to the former governor, is the only way to accord proper meaning to the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Mimiko, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, John Paul Akinduro, said the celebration of Christmas should be seen by all as an opportunity to share and exhibit love for one another.

While wishing Christians in Ondo state and the country at large a Merry Christmas, Mimiko urged them not to forget the lessons of love as one of the ideals of Christmas. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
