Debt Management Office (DMO) said on Monday that Nigeria’s total public debt increased by $20.0 billion between July 2015 and June 30, 2019. “The total public debt stock as at June 30, 2015, (shortly after the current administration came into office), was USD63.81 billion, and not USD7.0 billion.” DMO in a statement through which it reacted to recent media reports alleging that All Progressives Congress (APC) government inherited a debt stock of less than USD7 billion in 2015 that has now increased to USD84 billion. “Nominal increase in the public debt stock between June 30, 2015 (USD63.81 billion) and June 30, 2019 (USD83.88 billion), was about USD20.0 billion, which is a far cry from the gross misrepresentation made at the live programme that the public debt stock increased by USD77.0 billion during this period. “The public debt stock data published by the DMO comprises a debt of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), the 36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “It is, therefore, erroneous to attribute the growth in the Public Debt Stock to borrowings by the FGN only.” It noted that while the public debt stock has increased, the increase is well guided by the objectives of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy, 2016 – 2019. “New borrowing was included as one of the strategies in the ERGP to be deployed in the near term, to stimulate economic growth and job creation.
