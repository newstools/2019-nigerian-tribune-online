A youth-based organisation, Wales Kingdom Capital, has donated equipment such as reflective jackets, boots, movable shades to the Ogun State Police Command, in securing the lives of the people. The founder of the organisation Jaiyeoba Daniel Wales, said the items were donated to the Police because of the onerous task of securing the lives and property of the State. While receiving the items, the State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, said the Command would continue to make the state safe for residents and uncomfortable for criminals. The CP admonished the youth not to engage in any acts that could hinder their progress in life, warning against cultism, robbery, cybercrime and other vices.
