The Nigerian Gas Association (NGA) has urged he federal government to leverage natural gas to create transformative change across various sectors and spheres of industry. According to recent statistics shared by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation research department, Nigeria’s proven Natural Gas reserve went up to 202 trillion cubic feet (tcf) from the initial figures in the past decades, steadily elevating the country’s capacity reserves to those of countries like Iran, Qatar, and Russia. Speaking to the Nigerian Tribune on the activities earmarked to celebrate the association’s contribution to national development in the last two decades of its existence, Mrs. Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, National President, Nigerian Gas Association, stated that “Natural Gas is that one singular resource Nigeria can leverage to create transformative change across various sectors and spheres of industry. As the NGA, we have worked resolutely over the past twenty years to foster a legal, regulatory and policy landscape for gas that is attractive to participants and investors, with the attendant multiplier benefits to the nation at large.” Since inception, the NGA has carried on its commitment to effectively champion the competitiveness and effective utilization of natural gas by promoting sound policy development, capacity development and best practices towards optimizing the economics of the entire gas chain while emphasizing environmental protection and safety.
