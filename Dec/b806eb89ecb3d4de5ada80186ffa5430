A yet-to-be identified soldier on Saturday afternoon killed a butcher over N200 bribe at the popular Kara cow market on the Lagos-Ibadan highway. The incident sparked an instant protest from other butchers in the area as they set the vehicles of the soldiers, which was parked at the market, ablaze. A resident of the area told the Sunday Tribune that “the incident happened around 3:30 p.m. when the butcher was going home. “The soldier accosted the butcher and demanded for N200 ‘gate fee’ from him before he would be allowed to exit the market. ‘In 20 years, Nigeria hasn’t made tangible progress in… Makinde and the principle of reciprocity Christmas: Church leaders preach hope, love among… Christmas without chicken “There was an argument between the two and the soldier stabbed the butcher after he insisted that he was not ready to pay any money. “The alarm raised by the butcher attracted other people in the market who raced to the scene of the incident. “Some butchers in the area chased the soldier and attempted to lynch him, but he shot into the air to scare them away.” It took the intervention of policemen from Isheri divisional police station and the Rapid Response Squad to restore peace. Sunday Tribune gathered that many butchers at the market had complained about the activities of the soldiers who regularly extort money from them. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
