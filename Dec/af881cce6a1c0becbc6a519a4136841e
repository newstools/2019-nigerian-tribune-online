Reacting to the call by a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State that the National Assembly should amend the constitution to allow President Muhammadu Buhari to contest for a third term, Falana said: “I hope Nigerians have not forgotten that when the Babangida-led junta was going to extend its tenure, we had the Association for Better Nigeria (ABN) that went to court that the 1993 presidential election should not hold. We thought it was a joke. So, very soon, Nigerians will have other manifestation over the third term agenda.”  SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
