General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, recently embarked on marathon evangelism across states. Adeboye led other clerics and members of the church in states in the South-West to mark this year’s Let’s Go-A-Fishing with the theme: “The Fullness of Time.” The programme, which kicked off in Ibadan, Oyo State, was also held in Iseyin and Ogbomoso. The evangelism was later moved to Ilorin and Rore town in Kwara State.

Speaking at the Ibadan event, Adeboye said Ibadan holds a special place in his heart, so he decided to come and pray for the residents of the city for God to give everyone a special testimony this season. In his sermon, he expressed the readiness of God to solve any problem that is beyond man’s comprehension, just as he charged Christians and Nigerians at large to abide in God. Before his sermon, Pastor Adeboye prayed specially for the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who was represented by his wife, Olori Rasheedat Adetunji. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
