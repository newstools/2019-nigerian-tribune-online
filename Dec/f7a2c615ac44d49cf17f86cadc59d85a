California-based Bruce Lee Enterprises, whose head is Shannon Lee, has sued a Chinese fast food, Real Kungfu, for using the image of the late kungfu star in its logo without permission and is, therefore, seeking a compensation of over 210 million yen ($30million), according to a Chinese media outlet, The Paper. The case was filed against the Real Kungfu chain in a Shanghai court on Wednesday, requesting that the food firm stop using the image and pay an additional 88,000 yuan to cover legal expenses.

Real Kungfu, which sells rice bowls with Chinese dishes, was founded in 1990 and has outlets in over 57 Chinese cities. Its logo is of a man dressed in a yellow long-sleeved top whose looks and stance are similar to Bruce Lee and his famed ‘ready to strike’ pose. The filing of the case comes as China has pledged to improve protection for intellectual property rights and apply stiffer penalties, one of the key topics in Beijing’s trade dispute with the United States.
