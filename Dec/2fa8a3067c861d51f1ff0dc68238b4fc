Kwagbe, who disclosed this at a prayer convocation in Jerusalem on Sunday, affirmed that “the need to pray for our nation at the moment cannot be over-emphasised.” According to her, “pilgrimage provides us a platform to see and meet God personally as we connect with the physical realities on sites of the things we heard and read in the Bible about the words of God.” Kwaghe admonished the pilgrims to take advantage of this year’s convocation prayer to worship God and build fellowship with one another.
