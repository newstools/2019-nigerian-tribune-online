I recently slipped in the bathroom and hurt my left ankle. I initially thought that I could handle the problem with hot water massage and liniments but X-rays confirmed a small fracture of the distal part of the Fibula bone.

You will definitely need a POP cast on the affected leg before the fracture can adequately heal. Kindly see a doctor for the appropriate treatment. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
