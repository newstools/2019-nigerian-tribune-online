The Presidency has frowned at the Punch’s resolve to henceforth address President Muhammadu Buhari by his Major General military rank and his administration as a regime because of what the medium said was his dictatorial tendencies. The newspaper had made its intention known in its front-page editorial published on Wednesday. While Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity) had said earlier in a statement that there was noting “untoward” in referring to the president by his hard-earned military rank, a separate statement issued by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity) maintained that the medium cannot change the title. The statement wondered why the newspaper did not change the designations of former military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. and former President Olusegun Obasanjo when they allegedly failed to comply with the rule of law. Shehu said the Punch’s new editorial policy came to the Presidency “as totally curious and utterly incredible.” The statement said: “The paper claimed that it is changing President Buhari’s official title to General because of his government’s alleged disregard for the rule of law.

The exact freedoms Punch claims are missing is self-evident here – in print, on the internet – for all Nigerians and the whole world to see. “There is nothing wrong with expressing contrary opinions to this government – nor being in opposition to the president: this is the right of every Nigerian.

Punch: oppose the government as much as you want to. “We welcome your contribution to the debate. But we ask you not to throw insults at the good voters of Nigeria for not agreeing to your choice at the last election. “Oppose in good humour: for that is the mark of the true democrat – that which you purport to be.

The Punch never changed President Olusegun Obasanjo’s title from the President to General Obasanjo, despite the latter’s refusal to comply with Supreme Court judgment, ordering him to release N30 billion of Lagos State local councils funds. “When General Ibrahim Babangida who wasn’t democratically elected assumed the title of President, why didn’t the Punch challenge him or address him by any title it so desired? “In fact, IBB closed media houses for several months and years, including Punch. “But the paper didn’t stop addressing him as President, despite the fact that he wasn’t elected. “It is obvious that the Punch newspapers are playing partisan opposition politics which has nothing to do with journalism. “The Constitution of Nigeria recognises the President as the formal official title of the occupant of that office. Can the Punch newspapers, in their hubris address the President as Prime Minister as it pleases? “Is it within the paper’s responsibility or power to change the official title of the man who occupies the office of the President? Does that mean any newspaper is free to address the Comptroller General of Customs a Colonel rather than his official title? “The Punch newspaper should separate journalism from partisan politics. What it is embarking upon is purely political and it is designed to play to the gallery and cause confusion. “Punch Newspaper’s double standards in cuddling some of our past dictators and their open contempt for President Buhari clearly show that the paper has sinister motives for its current curious editorial judgment. Its personal hatred for and animus towards President Buhari should not be allowed to becloud its good judgment.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
