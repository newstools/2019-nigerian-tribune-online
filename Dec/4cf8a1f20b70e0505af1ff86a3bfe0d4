Electricity workers under the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) on Wednesday shut down all power installations, and offices across, leading to power outage across the country. The workers, under the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), commenced a strike action, following a 21-day ultimatum given to the Federal Government over some knotty issues affecting the sector; and the failure of the government to dialogue with the workers. However, to arrest the situation, the Minister of Power, Saleh Mamman, summoned the leadership of NUEE to an emergency reconciliatory meeting by 8 pm,  Wednesday night.

Joe Ajaero, told Nigerian Tribune Wednesday night that the strike took off immediately after the expiration of the 21-day ultimatum on Tuesday night, warning that the blackout will continue as long as the government failed to dialogue and resolve the issues in contention. He said the strike was very successful as all power installation, offices, Distribution Companies (Discos) and Generation Companies (GenCos) were under lock. However, Comrade Ajaero pointed out that the outcome of the meeting with the minister, which commenced, last night would determine the next line of action. He pointed out that the industrial action was declared because it remained the only option since there was no dialogue with the workers by the Federal Government to resolve the lingering industrial crisis in the sector.
