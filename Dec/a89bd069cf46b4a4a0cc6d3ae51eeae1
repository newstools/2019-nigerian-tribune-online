The Commissioner of Police in Osun State, Mrs. Abiodun Ige, on Monday, described as untrue the reported arrest of two suspected kidnappers in the state. She maintained that the story was misleading, saying there was no arrest of two kidnappers in the state. Reacting to the development during a chat with journalists in Osogbo, Ige cautioned the people against peddling rumour or any information capable of causing tension and unnecessary apprehension. Her reaction came against the backdrop of the reported arrest of two Nigerien in Asa Ijesa by some local hunters. Ige, however, explained that the two Nigerien, Goza Tontoli and Bobo Abayi arrested by local hunters were herbal medicine sellers.
