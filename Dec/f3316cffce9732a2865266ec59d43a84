Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) has called on security agencies to put in place measures to tackle theft and broaching of cargoes in seaports by some miscreants. The union made the call on Monday in Lagos following reports of alleged pilfering, stealing and broaching of cargoes in the ports by some scoundrels. Mr Felix Akingboye, the union’s General Secretary in a statement said that bio-metric Identity card had not been issued to dockworkers in spite of repeated demands by the union. Akingboye said that issuing of identity card would distinguish the core dockworkers from the miscreants that daily troop into the pool.
