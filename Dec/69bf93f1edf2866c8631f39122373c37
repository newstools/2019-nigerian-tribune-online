I recently had sharp pains in my left loin. An ultrasound examination diagnosed small stones in my Left kidney. I was asked to take some drugs, plenty of water and stop fasting. I am not convinced that fasting has anything to do with the kidney stones. Moreover, as a Senior Pastor in my church, I need to fast regularly. I need some clarifications on this.

Some genetic diseases increase the risk for formation of renal stones. Some people are  more exposed to kidney stones, and this happens in the tropics, where residents are exposed to hot areas and dryness and the urine become more concentrated to form the nucleus for the stone. Synthetic calcium-rich food may increase the risk of developing kidney stones. The people who use diuretics or consume many antacids containing calcium could increase the amount of calcium in the urine and increase the risk of stone formation. Your doctor’s recommendation to avoid fasting is because fasting causes dehydration and a higher incidence of stone formation. These days, those who fast are advised to take some water to avoid the high incidence of Kidney stone formation that has been confirmed among those who fast regularly. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
