I quickly rushed to a nearby Fidelity Bank and asked someone I know who said a promo was ongoing and I should go to the regional office.”  I am here now and I have seen it is real and I am very happy because this Christmas will be joyous for me. I want to thank Fidelity Bank for keeping their words”. Speaking earlier, the Managing Director/CEO, Nnamdi Okonkwo said lucky customers of the bank will cart away N120m at the end of the promo in April 2020, pointing out that N15m was won during the first draw in Ibadan and N19m in Abuja, bringing the total to N34m after the second draw. The MD/CEO who was represented by the Regional Bank Head, North West 1, Mannir Ringim said the promo which started in October 2019 was part of its efforts at deepening the Financial Inclusion strategy of the government and ensure more people are financially included. “As we speak, over 50 million Nigerians are financially excluded, which represents about 45 per cent of our population and we in Fidelity Bank want to bridge this gap and also encourage more people to embrace savings culture,” the MD/CEO opined. Shedding light on how people can qualify for the draw, Mrs Janet Nnabuko, Head of Savings, said both existing and new customers can win by simply topping their account with N10,000 for existing customers or someone opening a new account and building it up to N20,000. She further disclosed that to qualify for the star prize of N3 million one needs to build his account to N50,000 while aspiring for the Grand prize of N10 million, one only has  to grow his account to N200,000. Abuja Regional Head, Mrs. Vanessa Mordi said the bank was people friendly and remains committed to empowering Small and Medium Enterprises and also supporting individuals with surprise packages like the Get Alert in Millions Savings Promo.
