President Muhammadu Buhari has noted that climate change is steadily taking a toll on income of families as farm lands get narrowed with desert encroachments, while the vagaries of the weather pose greater risks for the future. Speaking while receiving Letter of Credence of the High Commissioner of Australia to Nigeria, Mrs Claire Ireland, at the presidential villa, Abuja on Thursday, he said the global attention on taming the effects of climate change is important, noting that population had been on the increase in Nigeria, and lands for investment and farming have turned more competitive. A statement issued by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), quoted him as saying: “Before now 10 to 15 members of a family could own a land, but the desert encroachment and growth in population has created a situation where you can have 200 people struggling over a family land.” The President said the effect of climate change on Lake Chad had created more economic challenges, with the shrinking lake rendering many jobless, and leaving them with little or no options for survival, except crime. In her remarks, the High Commissioner said Australia had maintained consistent economic growth for 29 years, scoring a record of development indicators that many countries had not been able to attain.

My mandate is to improve trade and economic relations. We are facing sanctions and we implore your support for our country,’’ he said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
