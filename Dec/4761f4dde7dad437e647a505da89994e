Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has explained that Federal Government did not release Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky along with Omoyele Sowore and Ibrahim Dasuki. Speaking to  BBC Hausa and the Hausa Service of the Voice of America, Malami also insisted that Sowore and Dasuki’s releases were not influenced by either internal or external pressures. According to him, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky remains in custody because the Federal Government does not interfere with the cases that are being prosecuted by state governments. The Minister said Government released Sowore and Dasuki based only on compassionate grounds. “The only reasons for the release of Omoyele Sowore and Sambo Dasuki revolved around our commitment to the rule of law, obedience to court orders and compassionate grounds” ALSO READ: Buhari hails Ahmadiyya’s ‘excellent’ propagation of Islam “It is important to understand the fact that as far as the law is concerned and in relation to the Nigerian justice system, one has multiple options after a court has ruled on a matter”. These options, according to the Minister include the right to appeal the said ruling, the right to ask the same court that issued an order to vary or review the terms of the order as well as the right to request for Stay of Execution of the order pending the hearing and determination of an appeal in that matter”. He maintained that it was in line with the above provisions of the law that the Federal Government considered the relevant court orders in respect of these cases.

Malami repudiated the claim that his office has received any formal communication from any American Senator on the matter and that the discussion during the visit of the American Ambassador to Nigeria at the event of the submission of a letter of credence was not in any way connected to the accused persons. “Even if we received any communication from them, that will never be the basis on the part of the Federal Government to obey or disobey court orders emanating from Nigeria”, he said.

If there is a strong suspicion of committing an offence which deserved, as a matter of necessity, to be investigated through legal steps then there was no room for thinking of witch-hunting an individual, scoring acrimonies or personal vendetta against anyone,” he said. He recalled that all individuals that were suspected of committing offences at various levels and at various times were charged to court with some granted bail based on the merits of their cases. “The time has now come for Sambo Dasuki and Omoyele Sowore to also enjoy bail based on the merit of their individual cases. “They were charged based on their individual cases, taken to court, granted bail and now have been released. “All the individuals involved were treated fairly and justly; they were taken to court, enjoyed the court’s favourable discretion and they were all released,” he said.
