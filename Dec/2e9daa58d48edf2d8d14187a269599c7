The House of Representatives, on Wednesday, urged the Federal Government to immediately commence the preparation for the conduct of a comprehensive national census before the end of 2020. This followed the adoption of a motion on the need to commence the exercise moved by Honourable Ademorin Kuye at the plenary presided by the Speaker, Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila. Adopting the motion, the House lamented that it was unfortunate that Nigeria had relied solely on projections by foreign bodies on her population figures for planning, adding that it was extremely important to conduct a new national census in the national interest. Leading the debate, the lawmaker stated that population census was an important national assignment because its figures were critical for national planning which should be taken very serious by any country. He argued that the lack of accurate data on the population of Nigeria had been affecting national planning and development at all levels and therefore asked the House to compel the National Population Commission to come up with a comprehensive timetable for the conduct of the census. He explained that it was because of its importance that countries across the world carry out this exercise once every ten years, adding that without a census, and an accurate data of the number of people in a given country, no government can provide adequately for its citizens.

Honourable Kuye expressed concern that the last national census was conducted in 2006, adding that until it becomes mandatory to conduct a census at given intervals like elections, Nigeria will continue to have delays in organizing national census. He disclosed that it had become extremely important to conduct another census to ascertain the country’s actual population in order to do away with projected figures, a development that will enable the Government to plan better for the citizens. He expressed concern that if adequate measures are not put in place to ensure that population census is conducted periodically, at least once every 10 years, Nigeria will be lacking in the statistical data of its citizens either politically or economically. Honourable Kuye said further that in 2016, the World Bank estimated Nigeria’s population at 186 million, while the United Nations put the figures at 180 million with a growth rate of 2.7. He said that in 2018, the National Assembly called for the postponement of the proposed 2018 population census on the ground that such an exercise, coming on the eve of the 2019 general elections, could end in chaos. The lawmaker acknowledged the fact that Nigeria was a dynamic economy with a large population which is expected to double in the next two decades, adding that the national census was, therefore, a pivotal and necessary tool for the growth of any emerging society. The House resolved to ask the Federal Government to put an end to the uncertainties surrounding the nation’s actual population by putting in place necessary machinery to conduct the national census not later than 2020.
