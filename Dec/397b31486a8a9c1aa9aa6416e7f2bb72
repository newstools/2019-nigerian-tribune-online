The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has downplayed the significance of Tuesday’s release of detained former National Security Adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd) and online newspaper publisher, Omoyele Sowore, saying that it would not change government’s attitude towards the rule of law. Reacting to their release from detention, the National Publicity Secretary of the main opposition party, Kola Ologbodiyan, said there was nothing to be excited about in the government’s directive to free them in line with the bail granted to them by the courts.
