The Oba of Benin, Ewuare II has urged traditional rulers in the state to fast and pray for peace in the state ahead of the Edo governorship election in 2020. The Oba gave the charge at the quarterly meeting of Edo Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs in Benin on Saturday. The monarch said the prayers and fasting should go along with the offering of sacrifice to Almighty God and their ancestors. Ewuare, who is the chairman of the council, said that the call for prayers became necessary in view of the current political crisis in the state, a situation, which he stressed had “become a serious concern to everyone.” Lagos govt reopens Club Quilox Army intercepts 85 bags of smuggled rice in Ebonyi community Police, soldiers kill one, arrest three armed robbers… Day of mourning in Kazakhstan following plane crash that… ALSO READ: Army intercepts 85 bags of smuggled rice in Ebonyi community The Oba said that he was sure that the state would be peaceful in spite of the current face-off among the political gladiators.
