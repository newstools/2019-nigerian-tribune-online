The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), on Wednesday, said the declaration of Nnamdi Kanu’s lawyer, Barrister Ifeanyi Ejiofor wanted by the Nigeria Police Force was a plot to kill the group’s struggle for the actualization of the sovereign State of Biafra. Nigerian Tribune earlier reported that the Anambra Police Command had on Tuesday declared Ejiofor wanted in connection of the alleged killing of two police officers in Oraifite in the Ekwusigo Local Government Area of the state during a fracas on Monday afternoon. But in a statement by IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, made available to newsmen in Awka, the group said the main reason for the declaration was to intimidate lawyers from taking up briefs from its members. Powerful disclosed that the group lawyer was innocent of the allegations level against him by the Nigeria police. The statement read in part,” The only reason why the police declared our lawyer wanted is to stop him from handling IPOB cases and to make sure he does not attend court in January 2020. ” Part of the wider motive, however, is to intimidate lawyers into not accepting IPOB cases. In their warped thinking, Aso Rock thinks this will pave the way for spineless judges to do their bidding. They want to use the courts to stop the raging Biafra agitation. He said “The purported and useless declaration made by the Commissioner of Police, Mr John B. Abang, in Awka against IPOB lawyer Barrister Ifeanyi Ejiofor is baseless and laudable. ” We all are aware of how this same Nigeria Police and the military used the same words when they invaded the home of our leader on September 14, 2017. “They can go on deceiving gullible Nigerians about their motive for the barbaric invasion of Barrister Ejiofor’s home but the facts are all there for the world to view.

Police shooting sporadically in the compound of a man they claim they invited for questioning leaves their motive in no doubt in the minds of the public. They came to kill him.

Meanwhile, the Oraifite Improvement Union (OIU), Anambra State has condemned violence and lawlessness which resulted in last Monday killing of two senior police officers. “Two senior police officers, a serving assistant commissioner of police and assistant superintendent of police were killed on Dec 2 in Oraifite community in Ekwusigo local government area of Anambra state. The community in a statement made available to newsmen on Wednesday in Awka banned six masquerades groups whose activities allegedly caused the problem in Oraifite on Monday afternoon.

The community stated that what happened on Dec. 2, 2019, leading to the killing of some men of the Nigerian Police Force was uncharacteristic of Oraifite culture and tradition. “The acts are condemned without equivocation in its totality. The good and peace-loving people of Oraifite totally dissociate themselves from the acts of the criminals responsible for the abomination. “The OIU, the Isi Obi of Oraifite, the Obis of Oraifite, the Quarter Chairmen and the entire people will provide full, unrestrained and active support to the Nigerian Police Force and other Law Enforcement Agencies towards a fair and effective investigation of this dastardly act in order to bring all those directly, and indirectly responsible to book”, the community stated. The statement added that the criminal activities of certain nefarious groups which acted as catalysts to the tragic events of Dec.2 have been proscribed and banished from operating in Oraifite. The community warned that anybody found to indulge in any of the proscribed practices shall be immediately apprehended and handed over to Law Enforcement for due prosecution as a criminal. Oraifite people further stated that all groups proscribed by law or through the exercise by any constituted authority of Government- whether State or Federal-or legitimate powers of office, have no place of operation in Oraifte. They, however, expressed heartfelt condolences to the Nigerian Police Force in particular and the families of the officers who lost their lives in the unfortunate incident. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
