The Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism has postponed the presentation of award to the Nigerian Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo. According to the organisation in a statement signed by its Executive Director/CEO, Motunrayo Alaka, “the postponement was decided on, to align with protests against the repression of freedom of speech in recent times especially the incident between the Department of State Security (DSS) and Omoleye Sowore, Publisher of Sahara Reporters, on Friday 6 December.” Alaka said in the statement that, the Vice President himself shares this awareness and the inappropriateness of the award at this point.
