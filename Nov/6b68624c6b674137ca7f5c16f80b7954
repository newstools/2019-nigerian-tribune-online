Kostveit frowned at the poor storage facilities for imported seafoods in Nigeria, especially the move by some traders to preserve seafoods with insecticides that are harmful to human. He said the best way to preserve seafoods exported from Norway is through the natural preservation process practiced by Norwegian Seafood Council, which takes a minimum of three months to naturally dry and preserve seafood in the open air.
