The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared the rerun election in Kogi West senatorial district inconclusive. The returning officer, Professor Olayinde Lawal, announcing the results said the margin between the candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Smart Adeyemi and that of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDD), Senator Dino Melaye is 20,570. In the election result as announced by Professor Lawal, Mr Adeyemi polled a total of 80,118 votes, while Senator Melaye got 59,548 votes from votes counted in the seven Local Government Areas in the senatorial district. According to the INEC returning officer Professor Lawal, he said the total margin between both the two candidates is lower than the 43,127 registered voters in 53 polling units of 20 registration areas in the zone where elections were canceled, as a result of which the rerun election was declared inconclusive. Professor Lawal said he was constrained by law to declare a winner because of the lead margin between the leading candidates, adding that INEC will announce a new date for the conduct of a supplementary election in the 53 polling units before a winner can be returned.
