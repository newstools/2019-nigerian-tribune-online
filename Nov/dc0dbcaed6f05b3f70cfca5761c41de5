The National Coordinator of South-East All Progressive Congress (APC), Young Progressive Forum, Comrade Otimkpu Paschal Chizoba, has urged Igbos living in Kogi state to come out en-masse on Saturday 16th November 2019 and vote wisely and massively for the re-election of Governor Yahaya Bello and APC. In a statement, Comrade Chizoba urged Ndigbo living in the state to reflect and check the past and know the kind of people they had been associating with before now because “all that glitters is not gold”. He said: “It is on record that security of lives and properties of Igbo people living in Kogi has been well protected under the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello. Our people have not had it so good. Some people and parties have been going about promising Igbos heaven on earth.
