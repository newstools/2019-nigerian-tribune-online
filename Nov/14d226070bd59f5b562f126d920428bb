Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, on Thursday in Lagos appraised policies of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, saying they were for the good of common Nigerians, as most farmers in the country were currently smiling to the banks as a result of border closure and more enrolment in schools due to free feeding for school pupils. Akume said this at a press conference held after reading the communique for Minister, Stakeholders Retreat to develop strategic plan 2019-2023 for Federal Ministry of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, with part of the communique calling on the government to realign its climate change policy to stimulate employment generation and wealth creation. “President Buhari’s policies are for the good of common Nigerians.
