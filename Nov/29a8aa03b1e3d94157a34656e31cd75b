Nigerian Young Farmers Network (NYFN) has urged the government at all levels to support youth in businesses to grow the economy following the recent border closure. Mr Promise Amahah, the national coordinator made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Monday. NYFN is a network that brings together young people in Nigeria to engage actively in the Agribusiness value chain and value-added services, to bring about shared prosperity and sociology-economic growth such as food security and wealth creation. He explained that there must be a deliberate effort by the government to increase the participation of young Nigerians in the farming business through soft loans to boost the economy of the country. He said strategic youth engagement was the best option for the country because of its huge population of young people.
