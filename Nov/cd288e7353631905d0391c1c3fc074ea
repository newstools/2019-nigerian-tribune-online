While cautioning the staff of Osun and Oyo to shun any rift, Makinde said he will, on Wednesday, inaugurate a committee to advance the way forward for the institution. It would be recalled that the Osun state government had also recently released N250 million to offset salaries and formed a committee to look at all the issues surrounding the joint ownership agreements and proffer lasting solutions to the challenges. Earlier, the Vice-Chancellor of LAUTECH, Professor Michael Ologunde, disclosed that a total indebtedness of the two owner state governments of Oyo and Osun to the institution stood at over N6 billion. Representatives of staff unions and other stakeholders who spoke at the forum agitated for sole ownership, steady academic calendar, the offset of outstanding salaries and warned against any attempt to privatise the institution.
