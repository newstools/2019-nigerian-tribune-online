I want to advise the Oyo State government and well-meaning indigenes of the state to find a lasting solution to the persistent problem of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), which is having constant issues. It is shameful that Oyo State with her blessed man power and experience can be easily manipulated in a property where it has stake. Therefore, there is a need for the people of the state to come together to work on how to bring the school with all the responsibilities to the state, after all, two men can not marry a woman as wife. On Ogun sports bill Changing outdated curriculum Unknown fate of Kogi voters Does title matter? Engr. Seyi Makinde’s style of administration and his total commitment to education and other infrastructure, as he rebuilds Oyo state, gives us hope. Enough of delaying our children’s education; it is time for Oyo state to wake up. The condition of the teaching hospital at Ogbomoso is sad, modern equipment procured by government were not installed; it is time Osun state withdraws since it has established its own standard state university.  Joint ownership is a setback to LAUTECH while the Osun State University is advancing smoothly because of its sole ownership status.
