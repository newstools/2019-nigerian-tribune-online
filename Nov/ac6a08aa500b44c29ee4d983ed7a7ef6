President Muhammadu Buhari has strongly condemned on-going violence in the Boki Local Government Area of Cross River State, which has in the last 24 hours led to a yet to be ascertained number of deaths and arson attacks. According to a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), so far, there have been claims and counterclaims as who restarted the killings and arson between the neighbouring communities of Nsadop community and the Boje community. The statement said while the origin of the mayhem was still unclear, President Buhari noted that no dispute or grievance was worth the violent snatching away of another person’s life.
