THE Olubaka of Okaland, in Ondo State, Oba Adebori Adeleye, has urged Nigerians to imbibe the spirits of perseverance, tolerance, and honesty which, he said, made it possible for Prophet Muhammad to spread Islam across the world. The traditional ruler made the plea in a message in which he felicitated Muslims on the occasion of this year’s Eid-al Maulud, the birthday of the Prophet. Oba Adeleye cautioned Nigerians against hiding under the guise of religion to foment trouble as, according to him, peaceful coexistence is critical national growth and development.
