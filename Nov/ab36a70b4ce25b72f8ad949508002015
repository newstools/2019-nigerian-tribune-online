UNION Bank Nigeria Plc (UBN) in its unaudited financial statements for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019, has made a five per cent increase in its profit before tax (PBT). In its financial statement submitted to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday, the bank reported a profit before tax of N15.6 billion for the period, having increased from N14.9 billion the previous year. Gross earnings, however, went down by four per cent to N117.2 billion from N122.2 billion in the previous year due to a decrease in average earning assets. Interest income also went down by two per cent to N90 billion for the third quarter when compared with N91.5 billion recorded in Q3:2018. Customer deposits increased by four per cent to N892.9 billion reflecting the bank’s continuing acquisition of low-cost deposits driven by strengthened brand affinity.
