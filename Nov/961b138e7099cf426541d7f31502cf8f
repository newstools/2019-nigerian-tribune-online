Voting has been concluded in Kogi West Supplementary Election in Kogi State. Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rescheduled the voting exercise in some polling units in the re-run election held last Saturday. Results from the re-run election had put the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Smart Adeyemi, ahead with 89,153 votes while Senator Dino Melaye trailed behind with 59,000 votes. However, INEC cancelled 20,157 votes and declared the election inconclusive. Tribune Online reports that as sorting and counting of votes was completed at the unit on Saturday, activities resumed at the collation centres of each of the local government. Voting went on peaceful in Lokoja and other areas of Kogi West, including Odolu in Kabba, Aiyetoro-Gbedde and Demonstration Primary School, Asuta Ward, the voting unit of PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. At the Ward B Unit 001, Karaworo, near Pararanda, in Lokoja, accreditation began as early as 8 am, after which voting commenced. While the early hours’ voter turnout was impressive, there was voter apathy later, as few or no voters showed at some of the polling units three hours before the close of the voting exercise at 2:00 pm. Sorting and counting were done easily and quickly without rancour. Early report shows that in GRA Asuta ward 01 Kabba, APC had 254 while PDP had 95 but at Town Hall, polling unit 002, Asuta Ward in the same town, APC had 48 while PDP had 98. Votes cast at each affected polling units will first be collated at the local government level before being transferred to Lokoja, the Kogi State capital where it will be added to the initial result before a final announcement will be made.
