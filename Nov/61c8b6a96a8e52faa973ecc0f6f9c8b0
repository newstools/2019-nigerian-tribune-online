The Spiritual Leader, Sacred Cherubim and Seraphim Church of Nigeria, Solomon Alao, has urged Nigerians to always seek God’s intervention to overcome the nation’s challenges. Alao, who is also the Supreme Head of the Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church Worldwide, made the plea on Friday in Lagos State. He spoke on the ordination of his son, Solomon Alao (Junior), as the new Minister-in-Charge of The Holy Mount of Salvation (Model Parish) of the same church. According to him, the son’s choice came through divine inspiration and people’s choice. Alao’s son is the third person to head the parish and would take over leadership of the church from the late Apostle Emmanuel Adegoke.
