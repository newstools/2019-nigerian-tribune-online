Following the order of Hon. Justice Chuka Austine Obiozor of the Federal High Court, Lagos, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has taken over two properties belonging to Hon. Ademola Seriki, in Lagos and Abuja over an outstanding indebtedness of nearly N1billion. The case between AMCON and Seriki, who was a former Minister of State for Defence as well as a former Supervising Minister for Mines and Steel Development have been lingering for a while now. A statement from the corporation noted that AMCON does not in the first instance resort to the courts except when the obligor defiles all overtures from the bad bank for a peaceful resolution of an obligation.

The affected properties include that which is located at No. 1a & 1b, Jalupon Close, Surulere, Lagos and another at No. 4, Djibouti Crescent, a high-brow area of Wuse 2, Abuja. The Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) of Ademola Seriki was sold to AMCON by the defunct Oceanic Bank and Skye Bank. When all efforts to amicably resolve the loan was frustrated by the former minister and a prominent member of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), the corporation was left with no other choice than to defer the matter to court. Having looked at the case over time, the court ordered AMCON to take over the assets of the APC chieftain. Jude Nwauzor, Head, Corporate Communications, AMCON, confirmed that AMCON earlier today (Monday) carried out the order as directed by the Federal High Court. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
