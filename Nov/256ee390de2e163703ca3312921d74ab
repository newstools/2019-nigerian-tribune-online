The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has called on insurance brokerage firms that participated in the expression of interest to insure NNPC’s oil and non-oil assets to be wary of anyone who would promise to help them win the bid as the corporation does not operate in such a shady manner. The GMD gave the warning Thursday at the NNPC Towers, Abuja, during a public opening of bids for insurance broker for NNPC Oil/Non-Oli Assets and Liability For The Year 2020/2021. “I want to put it on record today that anybody that promises you that he is going to help you win this bid is a liar, a fraud. If you know anyone who makes such claims, please let us know so that we can take appropriate action”, Kyari charged representatives of the insurance brokerage firms. He assured the firms that the evaluation and selection process would be transparent and accountable in keeping with the corporation’s Transparency, Accountability, and Performance Excellence (TAPE) agenda. He there would be a level playing field for all the bidders to guarantee the emergence of the best among them based on their respective track record and commitment to excellence.
