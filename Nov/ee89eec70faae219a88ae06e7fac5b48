Scores of people came out en masse in Lagos protesting the release of the publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore. The demonstrators marched to the Lagos headquarters of the State Security Service (SSS) on Tuesday around 10:25 a.m. They demanded the release of Sowore who had been detained since August by the SSS in Abuja despite meeting two separate bail conditions given by two different judges. One of the protesters, Ayo Ademiluyi said they have come to receive  Sowore upon the acceptance of the Security apparatus to act in accordance with the court’s ruling. “This morning we came peacefully to receive Omoyele Sowore.

Ademiluyi noted that the protesters were also challenging the vandalisation of Nigeria’s Democracy by Muhammadu Buhari. Meanwhile, the protesters accused the operatives of destroying the country’s democracy having been barricaded by fully armed police and SSS officers. “The Department of State Services has buried our democracy and destroyed everything that is remaining for the democracy,” Ademiluyi said. “We met this place militarised, we have no guns, no bullets but you see them, they have paraded this place with guns and bullets.” It would be recalled that  Sowore, a presidential candidate in the last elections, was arrested for calling for a revolution against bad governance in Nigeria. He is accused of treasonable felony and money laundering. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size and Lasting Power in just 7days… CLICK HERE
