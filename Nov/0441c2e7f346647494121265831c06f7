THE Oyo State government has warned intending partakers in the 2020 hajj in the state and their coordinators to be wary of fraudsters. The chairman of the state pilgrims’ welfare board (Muslim wing), Professor Sayed Malik, gave this warning while briefing newsmen in his office at the Hajj Camp, Olodo, Ibadan. Malik hinged this warning on complaints from intending pilgrims concerning registration for the next hajj exercise. He stated that the board did not give any condition different from the existing ones for the registration and did not authorise any individual or organisation to collect hajj fare on its behalf.

Malik also hinted that the state governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, had approved the commencement of registration for the 2020 hajj exercise following the presentation of the hajj operation report for 2019. He called on intending applicants to come to the office of the board for their registration. The secretary of the board, Mrs Khadijat Olanipekun, noted that the chairman had met with the board members and identified challenges of the 2019 hajj with a view to improving on the next exercise.
