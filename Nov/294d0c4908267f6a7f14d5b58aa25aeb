 Spiritual Father and chairman of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, Most Reverend Samuel Abidoye, has cautioned against empty promises by successive governments in the country. Speaking with journalists ahead of the 79th international conference/convention of the church, at its headquarters, Galilee Land, Orile Igbon on Wednesday, the octogenarian cleric warned of wrath of God associated with making empty promises. “In the past years even before the advent of this administration, there had been bundles of promises by these various administrations at the federal, state and local government levels which had always turned out to be empty promises. “Such empty promises include making life more comfortable for the citizenry, providing adequate security, provision of potable water, job creation, providing uninterrupted electricity and job security, especially for the teeming youth, good roads, providing quality education and adequate health care delivery, among others. Time will not permit me to breakdown these problems for you to know that they were mere and unfulfilled promises,” he said.

Prophet Abidoye also called on the government to take bold step on how to adequately preserve agricultural produces to avoid waste especially after being harvested so that there would be food all year round. The Spiritual Father noted that Nigerians should not be starving if agriculture had really been accorded the right priority. He commiserated with various communities and individuals affected by flood across the country and implored government to take decisive steps towards guarding against such occurrence especially those that are avoidable in the subsequent years. Prophet Abidoye called on the Federal Government to address the issue of security affecting the nation among others. The Spiritual Father also called for the relaxation of some economic policies such as VAT, the re-introduction of toll gate and unfavourable banking policies, among others.
