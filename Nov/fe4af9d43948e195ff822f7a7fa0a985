Barely a week after the governorship election in Kogi State, Hon Sunday Karimi who represented Yagba Federal Constituency in the House of Representative in the National Assembly has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Hon Karimi who formally declared his withdrawal from the PDP in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Sunday said it was with immediate effect. According to him, “I hereby withdraw my membership of PDP with immediate effect. I will hand over my membership card to my Ward. I will soon make public my decision about my political future very soon.” However, there are strong indications from his camp that he is heading to the All Progressives Congress (APC).

He, however, defected from PDP to the defunct, All Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and won the House of Representatives seat in 2011. The former lawmaker later returned to the PDP, a platform with which he also won the 2015 election. Hon Karimi aspired for election into the Senate in 2019 but was disqualified by PDP from contesting the primaries along with others in very strange circumstances. Though he took the PDP to court then, Hon. Karimi was later prevailed upon to abandon the court processes, which he did, and vehemently worked tirelessly for the party using his resources to ensure victory for the Senatorial candidate in 2019.
