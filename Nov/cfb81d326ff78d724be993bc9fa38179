At least 134 local contractors on Wednesday participated in an open bid held for the construction/rehabilitation of 26 urban roads recently advertised by Kwara State Government, conforming to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq’s insistence that contract awards would be made only after a transparent process. Yusuf Garba Manjo, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Works and Transport, said the Wednesday bids were the first phase of the exercise because roads for consideration under the phase 2 are still being compiled and are scheduled for execution in the first and second quarters of 2020. “The present administration under the leadership of AbdulRazaq is committed to ensuring that construction works are given to competent contractors,” he said. “In furtherance of this, the Ministry shall follow due process to ensure qualified contractors are awarded the projects to ensure quality service delivery to the people. We shall ensure strict compliance with the Public Procurement Act.” ALSO READ: Ease of doing business in Kwara will change — AbdulRazaq Reps wade into lingering management crisis rocking NDDC Reps support removal of PPT exemption tax, new 7.5% VAT,… Senate re-introduces bill to establish South-East… NASS moves to amend 1999 Constitution to increase… He said this road construction/rehabilitation is part of the urban renewal programme of the new administration.
