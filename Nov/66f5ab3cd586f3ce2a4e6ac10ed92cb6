Recently, It was reported that one of the armed robbers that had been terrorizing the people of Ikire, Ayobami Moshood, was arrested by a team of policemen posted to Ikire police station under the leadership of Mr. Samson Oke. I am so impressed with the way the Divisional Police Officer at that police station is committed to his work and is discharging his duty to get rid of criminals residing in Ikire. The need for policemen to always be on the alert in their area of operation cannot be overemphasized in order for them to curb the activities of criminals. Now that Christmas is fast approaching, it is high time that the police sat up and flushed the remaining criminals out of their hideouts around Ikire and in other locations. I want to use this opportunity to call on parents to take good care of their children so that they would be useful to this nation. What the Ikire DPO did to further arrest a murder suspect, Ojo Aremu, is good; no sinner must go unpunished Nigerians and the burden of religion ITUC-Africa holds congress in Abuja Orin-Ekiti: How herdsmen destroyed our multi-million naira… Socio-economic crisis, bane of crime and criminality… I want to commend the Ikire DPO for his efforts to combat crime within his jurisdiction. It is the duty of policemen to arrest criminals and charge them to court to face the full wrath of the law. This is the only way to reduce crime in our society. It is very unfair to see a man who is mentally sound and healthy to dispossess unsuspecting members of the public of their hard earned money and go scot free. The police should continue to work hard and get rid of criminals in our society. Jimoh Mumin Esq. Ibadan. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
