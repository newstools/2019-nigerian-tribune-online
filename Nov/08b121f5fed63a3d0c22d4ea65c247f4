Douye Diri voted was flooded, compelling the journalists to resort to local canoes to cross. The flood had delayed the setup of polling stations across the flooded community to about 10.16 a.m, two hours behind schedule.

Diri who voted at about 10.35 a.m. observed that the elections were peaceful in his area but regretted that he got reports of electoral fraud, violence in Nembe, Opolo and Enewari and other parts of the state.
