The lawmaker further observed that it is mandatory for all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to return all their unspent Personnel Cost to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) by the end of December 2019. “The House is concerned that the Commission is in dire need of funds, as most of its furniture and sundry office equipment are in poor condition as they were purchased over 10 years ago,” he told the House.
