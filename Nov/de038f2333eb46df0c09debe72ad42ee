Nollywood screen top shot, Elvin Ibru, on Monday said she would love to meet the armed robber who raped her in 2004. Ibru, a star actress, who played the role of Mopelola in the blockbuster movie, “Bling Lagosians” in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) urged rape victims to speak out. She said that having experienced the ugly incident, there was a need for others to take a cue from what she had been through which suggested her advocacy group. “I was raped by an armed robber in 2004, it wasn’t my fault and not an incident that warrants me taking up microphone about, so I set up an advocacy group to address it. “The group is to manage the young and old ones who had been through the same ugly incident like me. I know if I had to go all out to media about the situation, it will fizzle out. “However, it is not something I have been silent about; I don’t know the person that raped me, but I will meet him again, I know I will meet him,” she said. The multi-talented, actor, producer, director and writer, Ibru urged Nollywood stakeholders to be professional in their conduct, adding that the industry needed the touch of core professionals.
