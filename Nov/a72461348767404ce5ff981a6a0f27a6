The police in Lagos State have arraigned 47 men before a Federal High Court for allegedly engaging in amorous gay sexual relationships. The defendants were arraigned at about 4.12 p.m. on Wednesday on a one-count charge of engaging in a gay relationship. The accused, however, all pleaded not guilty to the charge. After their pleas, the prosecutor, Mr J.I Ebhoremen, applied for their remand in prison custody. However, the defence counsel, Mr Israel Usman, informed the court of a bail application, urging the court to admit the defendants to bail pending trial.

After listening to arguments of the counsel, Justice Rilwan Aikawa held that although the charges against them were serious, “it is, however, bailable.” The judge said that bail could only be denied following the circumstances spelt out by law, adding that in the case, the offence for which they were charged does not attract capital punishment. He, therefore, granted them bail in the sum of N500,000 each with two sureties each in like sum, one of who must be a civil servant on Grade Level 10, and the other with a reasonable means of income to be verified by the court. The court held that each of the defendants shall sign an undertaking not to delay the trial. The case was then adjourned till December 11 and SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
