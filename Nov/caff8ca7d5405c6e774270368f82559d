An early Monday morning fire incident caused by a petrol-laden tanker has resulted in destruction of property at Abesan Estate, along Ipaja Ayobo road, in Lagos. Residents in the area who couldn’t substantiate the cause of the fire incident, only narrated how they saw the tanker burning, with petrol spill which spread around causing destruction to property.
