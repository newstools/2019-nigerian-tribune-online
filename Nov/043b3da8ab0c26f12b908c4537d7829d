Oyo State government has warned all 2020 intending Pilgrims in the state and their coordinators to be wary of fraudsters. Chairman of the State Pilgrims’ Welfare Board (Muslim wing), Professor Sayed Malik, gave this warning while briefing the journalists in his office at the Hajj Camp, Olodo, Ibadan. Malik hinged this warning on different complaints from intending Pilgrims concerning registration for the 2020 Hajj exercise. He added that the board did not give any condition different from the existing ones for the registration and did not authorise anybody or organization to collect the Hajj fare on its behalf.
