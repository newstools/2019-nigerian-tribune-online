A large number of electorate defied the intermittent heavy downpour witnessed at Toru-Orua, the home country of Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State, to cast their votes on Saturday morning. When Tribune Online got to the polling unit at about 9:30 a.m, the voting centre at Oruwere Compound meant for the exercise had been flooded. Checks by Tribune Online confirmed that the entire structure was seen flooded. #KogiDecides2019: Shooting at Dino Melaye’s polling… 70 years on: Behold the 1st edition on Nigerian Tribune,… 40,000 persons displaced by floods in Borno ― UN #BayelsaDecides: Police, Army, DSS, others tighten security… ALSO READ: #KogiDecides2019: Shooting at Dino Melaye’s polling unit, ballot box carted away The voting exercise originally meant to hold at Oruwere Compound Ward 2 near the governor’s office later took place at Comprehensive Health Centre, Toru-Orua with four polling booths in Sagbama Local Government Area. The governor is expected to cast his vote at one of the four polling units, where no fewer than 260 voters are expected. Sandra Omenka, INEC’s Assistant Presiding Officer in Polling Unit 5, who spoke to Tribune Online, said the voting exercise was impressive and peaceful in spite of the hitch caused by the flood. One of the PDP agents, Mr Wilson Terry, expressed satisfaction at the exercise, adding that INEC had to relocate the polling units from Oruwere Compound opposite the governor’s house to ensure the exercise goes unhindered.
