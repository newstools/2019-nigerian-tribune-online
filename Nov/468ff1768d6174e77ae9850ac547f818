Second Republic politician, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, has said that the country will continue to fail as long as it remains under the leadership of either of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The elder statesman made this disclosure in an exclusive interview with Sunday Tribune during the week. “The APC is in power now in Kogi and Bayelsa.
