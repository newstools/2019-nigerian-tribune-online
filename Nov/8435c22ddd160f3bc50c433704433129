A large egg contains about 6 grams of protein. Eggs also are a good source of other nutrients, including vitamin D (which aids bone health and the immune system) and choline (which helps metabolism and liver function, as well as fetal brain development). But egg yolks are also known for their cholesterol. A typical large egg contains 186 mg of cholesterol, more than half the amount previously recommended for daily consumption before new research dropped the numerical goal in 2015, citing a lack of scientific evidence for a specific limit. But that’s not to say cholesterol makes eggs a harmful choice.  People at risk of heart disease; who have diabetes or who have had a heart attack should pay close attention to the amount of cholesterol in their diet. Otherwise, there is nothing stopping you from eating an egg a day at any age. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
