The National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) has adopted a new technology for HIV screening. NACA Assistant Director, Community Prevention and Care Services, Dr Yewande Olafa, disclosed this while speaking with the Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, on Saturday. Olafa said the new technology was that of a non-blood based test kit, designed to promote privacy and confidence among users. She said that the screening kit was oral-based with simplicity, accuracy and fastness in ascertaining one’s HIV status. “It is in line with the commemoration of World Aids Day with the title, “Community Makes the Difference,” in which we are engaging the community to help in the reduction of HIV spread,” Olafa said. She urged Nigerians to embrace the new technology for HIV screening, saying that HIV detection was not the end of life.
