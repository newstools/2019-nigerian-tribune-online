The resolution was passed sequel to the adoption of a motion sponsored by Hon. Tolulope Akande-Sadipe, who expressed concern over the conflicting amounts reeled out by various agencies. She noted that the World Bank estimated that global remittances grew by 10 percent from $633 billion in 2017 to $689 billion in 2018, with developing countries receiving 77 percent or $528 billion of the total inflows. “The House is informed that Egypt and Nigeria accounted for the largest inflows of remittances into Africa in 2018 with Nigeria leading in the Continent in terms of remittance receipts in 2017, and according to the United Nations official records, there are 1.24 million migrants from Nigerians in the diaspora and the World Bank Report also showed ‘that the Indian diaspora sent a whopping USD79 billion back home in 2018, making India the world’s top recipient of remittances and at the growth rate of 14 percent in inward remittances, India has registered significant growth in the flow of remittances over the last 3 years, from USD $62.7 billion in 2016 to USD $65.3 billion in 2017, remittances reached the $79 billion mark by 2018’.

To this end, the House mandated the joint Committees on Diaspora, Banking and Currency, National Planning and Economic Development to interface with the Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission, Central Bank of Nigeria, Money Transfer Operators and other stakeholders to investigate the actual amount of remittances in the last three years and report back within 4 weeks for further legislative action.
