Explaining why Nigeria and GECF members are focusing on gas development, the Nigerian leader said: “We are mindful of the energy deficit in the developing world especially, here in Africa where we have nearly 600 million people without access to modern energy. As responsible leaders, it is our duty to preserve the environment not only for the present but for future generations.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
