The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday night threatened to expel its member, Charles Enya, who filed a suit seeking the amendment of the constitution to allow President Muhammadu Buhari get another term in office. President Buhari, at the APC National Executive Committee meeting held last Friday in Abuja, said he was not interested in tenure extension beyond 2023 which he noted would be a breach of the Nigerian constitution But Enya, who served as organising secretary to Buhari during the 2019 general election, in a suit (FHC/AI/CS/90/19) filed before a Federal High Court in Abakaliki, the state capital, described the two-term tenure limit for presidents and governors as “discriminatory”.
