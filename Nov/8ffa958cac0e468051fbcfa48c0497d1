There is palpable tension among the staff of the Ekiti State University (EKSU) Ado-Ekiti over the alleged move by the authorities of the institution to sack over 500 staff, TribuneOnline has gathered. According to sources, those involved were workers employed during the tenure of Professor Samuel Oye Bandele as the Vice-chancellor of the university. One of the affected staff who spoke on condition of anonymity said the new chairman of the Governing Council and Pro-Chancellor,  Professor Bamitale Omole had expressed reservations over what it described over-bloated workforce in the institution.

The Academics Staff Union of Universities(ASUU) on the university had in September threatened to embark on strike owing to the inability to pay their salaries and other benefits. The ASUU chairman, Dr Kayode Arogundade, disclosed that the monthly wage bill of the university had increased from N380 million to over N502 million,  while the monthly subvention from government stood at  N260 million, leaving the university to grapple hard to make up for the N262m shortfall internally. When contacted, the EKSU’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Bode Olofinmuagun, denied any plan of management to sack or demote workers. “There is no tension on campus over sack issue, I am on campus as I speak with you. The university is peaceful and I am not aware of any such plan, ” he said. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
