THE Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Alhaji Dawud Akinola, has urged Muslims to always tread the path of peace in all their undertakings and do their utmost best to contribute to the development of the country. Akinola made the plea in an Eid-al Maulud message issued in Ibadan by his media aide, Akin Abolade. “A lot of lessons can be learnt from the birth and life of Prophet Mohammed and it is important for all faithful to imbibe these lessons for purposeful living,” the Muslim leader said.

He stressed that the government and law enforcement agencies were monitoring activities of individuals and organisations in the country. Akinola, therefore, cautioned owners of such facilities to properly register with the relevant government agencies and create a humane and conducive environment for the well-being of all inmates. He commended the Oyo State government under Mr Seyi Makinde for exhibiting strong character and maturity in the handling of the issue of such a centre in Ibadan. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
