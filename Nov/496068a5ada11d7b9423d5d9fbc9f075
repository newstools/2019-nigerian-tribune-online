President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has felicitated the African Newspapers of Nigeria(ANN) Plc, publishers of the Tribune titles, on the 70th anniversary of the newspapers. Lawan lauded the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, for his foresight in floating what is today Nigeria’s oldest private media outfit with the initial primary objective to project nationalist ideals at a time Nigerians battled to break the yoke of colonialism.
