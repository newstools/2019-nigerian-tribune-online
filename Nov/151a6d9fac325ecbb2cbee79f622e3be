The management of Delta Polytechnic, Ozoro, has banned the use of face caps by students on campus. The rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Job Akpodiete, gave this order at the weekend shortly after the burning of more than 5,000 face caps seized from students. Akpodiete, represented by the Dean of Students Affairs, Mr Thomas Ojuye, said the move was to check the incidence of indecent dressing among students on campus.
