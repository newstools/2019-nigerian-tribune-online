These include geographical neighbourliness and neighbourliness in terms of resources.  Nigeria is more of a gas-producing, rather than an oil-producing country. That fact had long been established. If we had followed our own plans, laid out in the 1970s, for the gas sector, we should have had 12 trains by early 1980s, instead of being on just six trains now.” The Special Envoy thanked Nigeria for the support it gave Equatorial Guinea to host the first summit of gas exporting countries in the world, taking place on African soil.
