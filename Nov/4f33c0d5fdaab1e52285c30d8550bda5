KANO State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has said that potable water supply in the state, is facing serious challenges because of obsolete water infrastructure, rapid urbanisation, population growth and imperatives of development, among others. He, however, said the state government, would soon commence renovation and upgrade of Challawa Water Works in Kano metropolis, which will cost millions of Naira. According to him, the project aims to improve the living condition of over 1.5 million people living within the Greater Kano axis by increasing access to quality water. Ganduje explained that the Challawa upgrade project would entail “provision of modern infrastructure, replacement of old pipes from the waterworks to the state capital and extension of reticulation to places where pipe-borne water is not available at the moment.
