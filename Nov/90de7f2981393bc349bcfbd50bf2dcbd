Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State has revoked all farmland titles and allocations that were made along with cattle grazing reserves in the state from 1999 to date. This is contained in a statement by Mallam Yusuf Idris, the Director-General of Press Affairs to the governor and made available to newsmen in Gusau on Saturday. Idris said the governor’s action had become necessary in order to address the issues of insecurity arising from farmers/herders conflicts strongly believed to be connected with the allocations of farmlands along with grazing reserves, cattle routes and forest reserves. He said Gov. Matawalle had also approved the constitution of a committee with a view to resolving the conflicts caused directly or indirectly as a result of the farmlands allocations in the state.
