Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has commended the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs(NSCIA) for promoting interfaith peace, harmony and tolerance. Osinbajo gave this commendation on Friday while declaring open a three-day General Assembly/National Executive Meeting (NEC) meeting of NSCIA at the Central Mosque, Abuja. He said the council not only promoted solidarity among Nigerians but it also served as an important intermediary between government and Muslim community and between Muslims and persons of other faith. “As the highest decision-making body of the council, I offer to you this morning both a commendation and a challenge. “First, the commendation to you for the great leadership you have shown in galvanising the Muslim community in Nigeria despite the denominational differences but for the making the council a vehicle for the promotion of interfaith peace and religious tolerance in Nigeria. “But the challenge that I pose stems from the theme of this meeting; permit me to put the topic in context so that we do not miss the essence of this topic.

The vice president then cited the courage of Imam Abubakar Abdullahi, who saved the lives of the over 200 Christians in his Mosque during the June 2018 clashes in the Plateau state and the Biblical story of the Good Samaritan. He said both the Imam and the Good Samaritan typified what leaders should be–ready for selfless sacrifice. He said that the Nigerian Constitution spelt out the equality of all Nigerians regardless of ethnicity, religion or status. According to him, the Constitution speaks of the imperatives of all individuals and governments to respect the lives and dignity of every Nigerian.

More so, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar, said that Islam was a religion of peace. He said that Nigeria, like any other nation, was facing challenges which would be surmounted in people across faith and ethnicity joined hands. Abubakar said that leaders should remember that leadership was all about service and not an opportunity to display pride and arrogance or boss people around. The Sultan said that the education of children is taken seriously especially the girl-child. “We are working hard; we are having a lot of joint programmes with the Supreme Council and the first lady’s office and very soon, you will see programmes that will be beneficial to the common people especially the women. “Beneficial to thousands of women who have been divorced by their husbands; thousands of young children who cannot go to school,’’ he said. He said that Nigerian Muslims were solidly behind good leadership. Earlier, in his opening remarks, Prof. Salisu Shehu, Deputy Secretary, NSCIA, said the meeting was the highest decision-making forum of the council. He said the resolutions would be for the general good of Islam and the nation in general. (NAN) SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
